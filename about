You've landed on my site. 

This is an experiment. This is where I am posting updates and ideas that come to me. 

Where are we? How did we get here? 

I am a world citizen, currently based in Bali, Indonesia. I've spent most of my post-university years in Hawai'i and California with meaningful episodes in Beijing, NYC, Shanghai, and Bogota. 

In my past, I have done many things to make a living. I've been a linguist in the Navy, a diplomat for the State Department, managed business development for small businesses and startups. Most recently I was a data engineer/scientist for a economic research firm. From these experiences, I know I can do whatever I want, whatever consumes me. 

At this point in my life there are certain things I cannot stop thinking about. These things consume my life, my mind. Surfing, health/fitness, markets. Within each of these domains, the mind-body connection is primary. I spend alot of time thinking about how to use these avenues to make myself something and someone I can respect. When I look in the mirror, I want to be at peace with what I see.
