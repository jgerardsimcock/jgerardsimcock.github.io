      <description>Trading and markets have been on my mind for a very very long time. I first became very curious about trading when I read about Jim Rogers trip around the world in 2000. A few years ago I thought about trading and purchased a course from Chris Capre at 2nd Skies Forex to learn to trade. I never finished the course. I told myself I would go back and finish that course some day.</description>

      <description>In the twilight of my temporal youth, I decideded to start over. In some ways, I feel that my life has just started.
When your mind is consumed with something, not doing/living that thing is a kind of painful dishonesty. My relationship with pain is perhaps different than most folks. I don&amp;rsquo;t like pain that leads to regrets. I welcome pain that leads to freedom, awareness and peace.
So enough bullshit.</description>
