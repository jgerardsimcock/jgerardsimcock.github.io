  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">It passes</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>On the ring, it was inscribed, &lsquo;This too will pass&rsquo;. So the story goes.</p>

<p>Yesterday a weight came down on my shoulders. It was heavy to live. I was upset about something and it was something I did not care about even a few weeks ago. It did not even exist in my world. It did not exist and then it did and then maybe it will stop existing. And when it did, I associated the thing with me. I was more because I thought I had the thing and I was less when I thought it could go away.</p>

<p>This thing, that consumes the living, the life force of the world, as the proof of its existence has been called many things. I guess it is ego. But that is a word and this is a predator. It could be a parasite, even. It uses your mind, body and spirit for its own perpetuation. It just needs a soma. It is a predator because it&rsquo;s relationship with the world is to take and hunt the best evidence for the proof of itself. The more exalted the better and it always wants more, bigger, faster, fill in the superlative.</p>

<p>And I found myself believing what the predator was telling me. What it needed, I was convinced I needed. As if my survival could be satisfied with accomplishing it&rsquo;s needs, its goals. I was living, acting as if it were true as if we were one.</p>

<p>But the predator is a also parasite and by this nature, it will destroy it&rsquo;s host. There is no peaceful coexisitence.</p>

<p>The ego is persistently playing the comparison game. It has no other basis for its existence. It&rsquo;s seduction is that it is the fundamental causer of events, that which leads to superiority and inferiority. It seduces you to compare, to play the victim and the hero, the conquerer and the conquered. And the seduction becomes an addiction until the addiction becomes so painful that you cannot continue.</p>

<p>And my body was in conflict, it sensed something, I was in real pain. I was living for something else. I had violated the covenant, I had dishonored the gift.</p>

<p>The gift is the moment, it is to experience the radiant joy of living. It cannot be captured and it serves no master. Well it does serve one master, itself, Being. It is not the basis for your ego&rsquo;s existence. In fact, when honoring the gift, the ego cannot exist. The gift is not about you. You can only honor it. The gift of living flows. You can only work with living, this moment, to express the superlative beauty of the union of man and the phenomenal world. Holding on to anything once the moment has passed, using it as proof or some basis for superiority or inferiority is the way of destruction.</p>
