  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">My Father&#39;s son</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I am my father&rsquo; son.</p>

<p>For a very long time, I&rsquo;ve been unable to accept this. My father was a complicated person. He was human, with good and not so good qualities. It is also the case that he was not around. As far as what part of me is from him and what is from my mom, it was always a bit of a process of elimination and some guess work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been coming to terms with this truth over the past few weeks. Again, I am still on this path of trying to find a new gig. It has been way more difficult than I anticipated. For the most part, I would still have done everything I did so far. However, I think I would have done more prep. Maybe I am over confident or just arrogant and even perhaps naive.</p>

<p>In any case, with regards to my father and the process of acceptance, I have noticed that during yoga class I have been having some deep and strong reactions when I start to get very hot. I start to panic. I start to have anxiety attacks. As I go into the anxiety attacks and try to identify what the source is, I come to one conclusion. There is this fear of abandonment. That fear of abandonment is related to this desire to be liked, accepted and welcomed. It is connected with my recent behavior and the series of interviews and subsequent rejections. Each rejection tends to reinforce this fear of exile, abondonment, and estrangement from my community. And each time I find myself in another interview giving myself away, giving away all that I value, my freedom, my honesty, my independence, for the cookie of being accepted and protected in the group, I oscillate between the self-loathing of self-betrayal and the fear and anxiety of exile, and abandonment.</p>

<p>And I wondered where did all this come from? When did this start? What is my earliest memory of this? My anxiety attacks go back as far as 1990 when I spent Christmas with my father at his girlfriend&rsquo;s house. I can remember waking up and being totally overwhelmed, my mind racing, being scared and not knowing how to control my mind. It was like my brain was racing away from me. I was 10 years old. As I think about this now, I wonder if I was finally putting together some awareness that my family was no more. My life would never be the same and I did not know how to process it. If there is one thing I have wanted all my life was to have my family back together again. To have a happy life with my parents and my sisters. To see my sisters happy. To see my mom happy. To see people in peace. It is the singular thing that broke my heart and has underpinned a deep state of grief in my being. And I think that the experience then with my sisters and my dad with another woman was this unreconciable proof that my family was never ever going to be together again. It felt like he had abandoned us for someone else and I did not know what that really meant other than it was uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The Guru says that his guru is the dharma, the configuration of each moment, inviting him to move forward into the moment and see what is possible. I&rsquo;ve heard certain esoteric interpretations of the bible that say something like, you can only see that God is there for you supporting you once all other sources of support have left, have abandoned you. God will never abandon you. The Dharma is always inviting you into the moment to help you realize and know, experientially, what is possible through trust and faith. We are children of nature, God, the dharma.</p>

<p>As I internalize these thoughts, I see how the need for security is form of attachement that is a kind of doubt and worry. There is almost no limit to the demands for a need for security. This moment I am safe, but could I be safer and what about tomorrow or ten years from now. This expansion of the mind, the use of the mind to create monsters, is a kind of mara-making and a kind of perpetuation of the ego. It is perhaps the role of the ego and its basis for survival, to come up with fears and desires and hypnotise you into running from fear and pursuing desire ignorantly. All self-created and maintained images. Alternatively, this is not the path of faith. This is not the path of God. This is not the path to communion with God. God would not put such images in your mind. You have lost connection with the divine source. You have given your mind to false gods created by the ego. It is to look for idols in this world for protection rather than the one true God.</p>

<p>And when it gets very tough, in those moments of anxiety and panic, when the residue of the abandonment come to my mind, I consider that the abandonment by my father helped me to see that God, dharma, nature all are there supporting me. But I must first accept that I am the son of my father, the extended father-son relationship of God and man, of each man with the dharma, of man and Nature.</p>
