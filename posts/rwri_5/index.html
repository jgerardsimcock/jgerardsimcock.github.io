  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">RWRI 10 Day 5</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>On the last day, class started the day with some anecdotes. In Nassim&rsquo;s own words: &lsquo;Verbally you cannot express your view of the world. You can be bullish and short because if you are wrong you win big. If you are right, nothing really happens because everyone else already agrees with you.&rsquo; What this means is that the payoff from being short and having that reality emerge is greater than the payoff from being long (bullish) since that expectation is already priced in.</p>

<p>One way I&rsquo;d say this is expressed is the statement: &lsquo;May you live in interesting times.&rsquo; To me this is the essence of the long volatility trade. It is neither optimistic nor pessimistic in an externally conditioned, naive sense. To me it is fundamentally optimistic, conditioned on your robustness to uncertain outcomes. It is also fun. Expecting and getting the same shit all the time is boring and such conditions create boring people.</p>

<p>The anecdotes continued with a story about a trader at Morgan Stanley. Their real-estate department had developed a bearish view and wanted a trader to help them build a hedge. The trader in question was a manager of the trading department, not Taleb, and someone not highly regarded. The trader put on hedges, something called a Triple Christmas tree, or a Tripe Ratio max spread. This trade has unlimited downside risk. Evidently, the option trader did not know this and ended up costing Morgan Stanley $15 Billion. The trader was focused on being right in frequency space and not concerned with payoff space. You can be right in frequency space and unharmed in payoff space when the expected happens. However, when you are wrong you are fucked, big time. And even payoff space can be complex because at some point your puts start to behave like calls because you need to be just long enough so that your counterparty is around to pay you. If they get wiped out you don&rsquo;t get anything. You have to limit your gains so that others can return to the game to keep playing with you. The infinite game, once again. And something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqTZCU_ViHg"><strong>Jordan Petersen</strong></a> mentions in the study of rats playing. If the dominant rat, dominates for too long, the other rats won&rsquo;t play with the dominant rats. So the dominant rat lets the others win so they want to keep playing.</p>

<p>Taleb then recounted his a story of pit traders in Chicago and a test that required pricing an option stategy given a visual representation of the payoff scheme. They had one minute to perform. If these are complex multi-contract strategies this can be very complex. However, he indicated that they had built heuristics to accomplish this and could do it very efficiently. Indicating that some of these people may not have high IQs as measured by standard tests but this IQ test they had mastered and was an ever better measure of real intelligence. They understood payoff vs frequency. Later in the day Taleb referenced <a href="http://www.edwardothorp.com/"><strong>Ed Thorpe</strong></a> as being a gambler/trader who became a mathematician. Matter of factly, he indicated that Thorpe had accumulated wealth of around $150 million. Thats alot. And he started out with basic heuristics and later on developed basic and effective quantitative gambling methods. I&rsquo;d maybe correct Taleb on this by saying that he too seems to have followed this path.</p>

<p>Taleb indicated that previously, lots of machine learning had tried to figure out how to do this and was using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function"><strong>sigmoid function</strong></a> to model these options. However, this capped the upper limits of the payoff, the convexity, and the right model for the option contract is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"><strong>Rectified Linear Unit (RELU) function</strong></a>. What the machine learning allowed the modelers to do was price in time value into there options so they could really get the non-linearities of the options.</p>

<p>He then went through and modeled a &lsquo;weird option contract&rsquo; and its payout. This was done to demonstrate the process of looking at a payoff and trying to model how to price it. Similar to the pit traders but this time using <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/"><strong>Wolfram Mathematica</strong></a>. He chose the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseTangent.html"><strong>arctan</strong></a> which is a kind of shifted sigmoid function. With limited upside and downside between two outcomes. This process was enlightening as he showed how he thinks about the whole process. It is much more intuitive than I had imagined and he uses computation to accelerate hypothesis testing with monte carlo. While it could be called &lsquo;math&rsquo; it felt more like exploratory analysis and visual hypothesis testing.</p>

<p>During this demonstration there was an ongoing discussion between Raphael, Taleb and the students about different types of trades, the payoffs for such trade strategies and the mathematical model used to represent those strategies. If I got anything from this section, I learned that I need to really pay attention when I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Hedging-Managing-Vanilla-Options/dp/0471152803/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547530847&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=nassim+taleb"><strong>Dynamic Hedging</strong></a> as it demonstrates alot of these trades and Taleb was pulling directly from the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hslpj8xcqtszmvv/Technical%20Incerto%20Vol%202.pdf?dl=0"><strong>Technical Incerto Volume 2</strong></a> with direct reference to Dynamic Hedging. Some ideas that were referenced were the Big Boob trade (It looks like it sounds), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Schwartz"><strong>Schwartz distributions</strong></a>, Heaviside functions, inverse Heaviside functions, and two Russian mathemitcians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Sobolev"><strong>Sobolev</strong></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov"><strong>Kolmogorov</strong></a>.</p>

<p>A few more anecdotes continued with Taleb narrating one of hist first blowups in the 80s. It was 1986 and Treasury was issuing a 30 year bond for 2016. There was one month that was trading more expensive than the month before and the month after. Evidently the Japanese postal office had bbought the bond and the Japanese people started following. Every bank was short and long that bond. Every time they short the Japanese bond, everyone in Japan buys it. (Note: I don&rsquo;t understand really the implementation of this) Some Wall Street types went to Japan to figure out what the fuck is going on. And to explain to them that they could buy other bonds of different maturites one month before or after. It did not matter. In the end, anyone that shorted that bond went bust. This seems analogous to don&rsquo;t fight the fed.</p>

<p>Two additional examples of this were brought up regarding <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/01/investing/herbalife-bill-ackman-carl-icahn/index.html"><strong>Ackman and Herbalife</strong></a> and the <a href="https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2008/10/17/17150/porsche-llc-the-vw-fruit-machine-explained/"><strong>Porsche/VW short squeeze</strong></a>. These are both examples of irrational situations that don&rsquo;t make sense and &lsquo;should&rsquo; not exist, according to some theory. However, irrationally abounds in the financial markets. And it may be irrational longer than you can stay liquid. So goes the saying.</p>

<p>Then Taleb narrated a story about second order affects and unknown unknowns in certain types of contracts. He had entered a trade that would require him to actually take delivery of oil and store it. There was some anomoly between front months and back months in the futures market so he planned to wait until prices increased to sell the oil back into the market. Two problems emerged with this trade. Due to EPA regulations, you could only store oil in specific types of storage facilities. This would generally not be an issue but a group of Greek shipping experts at Goldman Sachs had aquired all spare oil storage and shipping capacity for the interval and was planning on transfering the arbitrage benefit to themselves through the storage and shipping fee. He narrated that he would call them and ask to get a price and they&rsquo;d tell him to go fuck off and hang up. Not until desperation mounted would negotiations begin. Clearly, this strategy is well known among the Greeks. In Dynamic Hedging Taleb recounts a similar anecdote in the opening of the book:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The earliest option trade on record in Western literature was a bet on future crop by Thales of Miletus, which Aristotle recounted with great pride in his Politics. To benefit from a better than expected olive crop, Thales put a deposit on every olive press in the vicinity of Miletus. As demand for these grew, he sublet the facilities for profit, mostly to make the point that philosophers who so desire can achieve material success&hellip;Thales used the first derivative instrument, actually an option on a future, a second-order derivative at that! He did not trade olives, which he would have had to sell short, but chose to buy the equivalent of a call on the olive presses, for fall delivery, with the knowledge edge that all he could lose was his deposit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Dynamic Hedging: Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options</p>

<p>The conversation meandered to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/04/091504.asp"><strong>Kelly Criterion</strong></a> and how it can be used. It prevents you from investing too much because it is proportional. As you make money, it makes you take more risk. If you dynamically adjust expected return, it slows you down even more as you lose money. Double scaling up when winning, double scaling down when losing. It allows you to bet with the houses money when you are winning and preserve your capital when you are losing. It is good for a gambler since they have finite bets. At any point in time, they can revise. And even for some, a Kelly Trade may even be too agressive so you can do a half-Kelly. Kelly Criterion will violate academic beliefs about risk taking.</p>

<p>At some point, we got on to the topic of pricing resinsurance. Arie Haziza, a former student of RWRI and a professional in the reinsurance industry shared his experience that after an event, reinsurance rates are repriced. They go up and go up big time. To insure some buildings after September 11, firms had to pay %1.35 the value of the property. Huge. I know there are some firms that short volatility after a big event, suggesting it is good trade because subsequent events are less likely and people are willing to pay alot for insurance. That sounds dangerous. And if you did it and got away with it, you were lucky.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Taleb introduced <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/an-expert-called-lindy-fdb30f146eaf"><strong>Lindy effects</strong></a>. The idea is that the longer something survives, the longer it will survive into the future. At some point, it becomes a &lsquo;memorlyess process&rsquo; and its survival time extends at each time step. If something has lived for 4000 years, it can live another 4000. Basically if a phenomena is observed at, what appear to be, extremes, it can go much further. The temporal relevancy of something (idea, technology), we think is bounded. All things must come to an end, so we assume. But the ideas of city states, mercenaries, and gold that were perceived of as anachronistic or obsolete are coming back into relevance. They never went away. We tried alternative systems that in the end, may prove their terminal vulnerability to volatility.</p>

<p>Mathematically, we can see that some types of processes have positive memory, negative memory or are memoryless. Some animals, in fact, have a constant life expectancy, a memoryless process. On any given year, they have a life expectancy of n years. What does this mean? Only by hazard do they perish. Interestingly, human aging exhibits negative memory until a certain point and then it becomes memoryless. Most humans, in fact, die of something other than being old. It is usually a complication from some accident.</p>

<p>Most helpful in this discussion of Lindy effects and positive memory process was something about form and function. After 5000 years we still have tablets. They harness a different force but still how we interface with technology has not changed. The tools that humans use may appear to become obsolete but they are simply evolving through interactions with their environment. What it means to be human and what humans need to survive seems to be persistent through time. Food, shelter, rest, fellowship with others. All are part of the structure of human life and certain mediums have evolved with us to satisfy those needs even if they look different superficially.</p>

<p>Another part of human life that seems to persist across time is violence. This is something I&rsquo;ve had on my mind for almost 20 years. It seems, it is something in us that cannot be eliminated. Physical violence is the most explosive form of this but the mind perpetrates violence pyschologically, emotionally, and otherwise against itself and others. It is pervasive and the medium will shift to its most effective form. That being said, the belief that physical violence has decreased in step with a liberal, humanistic flowering of mankind sounds beautiful. I too am seduced by such an idea. However, <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2876315"><strong>Taleb and Cirillo showed</strong></a> us a study that cannot support this claim. While there may be detractors to this argument, its foundation is based on two ideas: extreme outcomes and potentially bad data. The latter, potentially bad data, was overcome by taking the diverging estimates of the physical deaths given by opposing sides associated with the same violent conflict. Since they both cannot be true and the truth is, likely, somewhere in the middle and in the aggregate any single conflict will not terribly shift the long-term distribution (in extremistan), you can use monte carlo to simulate the same conflict with both estimates of deaths for different draws of the monte carlo. The first idea, that extreme outcomes are more possible than you can conceive suggests that large-scale violence can be expected and the interarrival time between such events can be long. Your grandparents and your grandchildren may suffer but you may be spared. A quote from H.T. Buckle mentioned in the Taleb and Cirillo paper:</p>

<p>&lsquo;That this barbarous pursuit is, in the progress of society, steadily declining, must be evident, even to the most hasty reader of European history. If wecompare one country with another, we shall find that for a very long period wars have been becoming less frequent; and now so clearly is the movement marked, that, until the late commencement of hostilities, we had remained at peace for nearly forty years: a circumstance unparalleled (&hellip;) The question arises, as to what share our moral feelings have had in bringing about this great improvement.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was written before the US Civil War and the rest of the subsequent &lsquo;barbarous&rsquo; pursuits we witnessed in the 20th century. Additionally, as new extreme events emerge, even more extreme events become possible. And while its almost forgiveable that anyone with a mediocrastan filter and a social-humanistic bias would conclude that we&rsquo;ve entered a new age of peace, the careful consideration of interarrival time between conflicts will disabuse them of the fantasy. The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. One gnarly event will invalidate those views. Such is the belief-shifting power of the single black-swan.</p>

<p>A final thought on this: &lsquo;It is better to be a warrior in a garden, than a gardner in a war&rsquo;</p>
