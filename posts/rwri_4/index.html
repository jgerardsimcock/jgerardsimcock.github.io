  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">RWRI 10 Day 4</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: These are notes written a few days after completion of seminar. My apologies in advance for any exclusion or misapprehension of critical details. Also, to complement some of the lecture content, I&rsquo;ve added related content from other sources. Bold words are links.</p>

<p>On day four we discussed Extreme Value Theory, extreme prices in cryptocurrency, money laundering, cryptoassets at banks. Throughout the day we had discussions and stories bringing this into real-life.</p>

<p>Extreme Value Theory was presented by <a href="https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/27508"><strong>Andrea Fontanari</strong></a>. Quite honestly, even though I had read all of the books of Incerto, this idea was unknown to me. In Fontanari&rsquo;s (paraphrased) words Extreme Value Theory is the mathematical machinery that allows you to compute the parameters to prove a fat-tail. If statistics is data plus assumptions and your assumptions are wrong then (that your process is not fat-tailed) then you are misapplying the techniques. You cannot blindly apply them. You must understand the assumptions behind your techniques.</p>

<p>EVT allows you to uncover the behaviour of the tails of your data without requiring the distribution, given you are able to guess where the tail starts. You have to guess where the tail of the distribution starts. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_extreme_value_distribution"><strong>three different types</strong></a> of tails and each type can be summarized by the extreme value index gamma (1/alpha). We can estimate gamma with statistical techniques.</p>

<p>The three regimes are the heavy-tail, light tail, and finite tail. The heavy-tail regime where gamma/alpha are greater than zero. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_distribution"><strong>Frechet Distribution</strong></a>. Examples of this are the Pareto and the Students-t distribution. The tails of these distributions decay slower. The light-tail regime is where gamma equals 0 and the alpha is infinite. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution"><strong>Gumbel domain</strong></a> with an exponential decay in the tail. The normal, exponential and Poisson distribution are examples of the light-tailed. The Finite tail domain has a negative gamma, an alpha less than zero. This is known as the Weibull domain. Any finite distribution such as the uniform distribution is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution"><strong>Weibull domain</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Andrea&rsquo;s EVT framework is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Transform data to log-space and plot</li>
<li>Decide where the tail starts and decide k (number of obs in the tail)</li>
<li>Find and apply good estimator for the tail index: gamma hat</li>
</ol>

<p>A good example of the application of this procedure in finance is <a href="https://www.blackarbs.com/blog/asset-pricing-using-extreme-liquidity-part-2/12/11/2016"><strong>here</strong></a>. The idea is to create a metric and test each of our assets vulnerability to this metric according to an Extreme Value Theory approach to tail behaviour.</p>

<p>Next Robert Frey presented some research he had done on Bitcoin prices. He used a mathematica notebook with Bitcoin prices up through the day before the presentation to demonstrate. In passing he made the comment that the tails of the distribution matter in a serious way. Survivorship bias is everywhere and we see the winners not the losers and we compute the average over the winners. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Technologies"><strong>Rennaissance Technologies</strong></a> has survived because it took the tails seriously and has remained when other firms have perished. See <a href="https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/rwri_2/"><strong>Neiderhoffer</strong></a> story from Day 2</p>

<p>The question he wanted to answer was the following: &lsquo;is the Bitcoin price volatile&rsquo;? He transformed 1 day returns to log space and removed the volatile periods. When we plotted a histogram of the log returns we saw that the Normal distribution did not represent the distribution but a stable distribution with fat-tails like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_distribution"><strong>Cauchy</strong></a> worked. Fat-tailed distributions do exhibit long periods of &lsquo;normality&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s the excursions from the norm, however, that define the fat-tailed distributions. And if you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness"><strong>memory-less process</strong></a>, the excursions can happen sequentially. We do in fact see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_clustering"><strong>volatility clustering</strong></a> so such a thing is real.</p>

<p>Robert than started to draw some &lsquo;conclusions&rsquo;. From three years of empirical data, on any given day, you can expect to see a loss of 40% or more. Given that you exceed a 40% loss, the max you would lose is 44%. If you were to fit a normal distribution to the data, you&rsquo;d only estimate an 11% max drawdwon every 3 years. If you use a stable distribution, the theoretical drawdown you&rsquo;d expect is 65% with a max drawdown of 83%. Raphael remarked that there was indeed a day in which bitcoin went from more than $17,000 and caught a bid at something like $2500, about an 85% move down. Robert also said he had done a similar excercise with the other major cryptocurrencies and found similar behaviour.</p>

<p>Next we got a discussion from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Douady"><strong>Raphael Daoudy</strong></a> on Extreme Risk Management. Raphael has trademarked something called Dominant Factor Analysis. This is his framework to think through each risk factor individually. He indicated his skepticism that more data was better as a lot of data can be bullshit. The important thing was to understand where hidden risks come from and if they can be quantified. He showed us some very enlightening slide of sharpe ratio vs drawdown that followed in 2008. From the graph there was no way you could conclude that Sharpe Ratio was a helpful metric to avoid risks. For whatever strategy you are using, you have to identiy the risk factors and then evaluate your sensitivity to the risk factors. You need to know how nonlinear the risk factors are. The upside and downside risk are completely different and you have to be able to model that. He gave the example of a credit-driven fund that was long AAA corporate bonds and short T-bonds. You would be sensitive to the spread between these two instruments and it would be nonlinear.</p>

<p>Raphael&rsquo;s approach is the following when running the dominant factor analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify a large set of factors</li>
<li>Scan factors one at a time:

<ul>
<li>Select factors with a strong statistical relationship to the fund. Score/rank factors</li>
<li>Focus on extreme moves =&gt; Nonlinear Models, one extreme point is enough to tell you it is not linear</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stress Selected Factors

<ul>
<li>Information ratio = Impact of Factor to Uncertainty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Merge single-factor models to maximize information ratio</li>
</ul>

<p>In general his risk management lessons are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t repeat twice the same mistake

<ul>
<li>Accept that you&rsquo;ve done something wrong</li>
<li>Learn what you did wrong and what you should&rsquo;ve done</li>
<li>See when you are in the same situation and act accordingly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learn from Others

<ul>
<li>From past experience when you were not born</li>
<li>From others experience</li>
<li>Apply 1,2,3 from above</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Extrapolate: Anticipate the unexpected

<ul>
<li>Extrapolate the consequence of the worse than worst case scenario</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>After Raphael, we had another <a href="https://twitter.com/VergilDen"><strong>former RWRIer</strong></a> come and discuss risk at his institution. He talked about money laundering and cryptocurrency. He recounted a story of the largest hack/bank-heist from the Bank of Bangladesh. The moral of the story is that the hackers found a physical, technical and human vulnerabilities to the bank and were able to exploit them. The attack points are more than just cyber. He posed the question if we are ready for a world where a single person can compromise the whole financial system through the exploitation of critical pieces of the financial system. There are groups of hackers that all day long try to find bugs and holes in the banking systems of western countries and they monetize these discoveries into job offers, a kind of benign extortion. Some could have less benign intentions.</p>

<p>He then detailed some of his thinking on crypto usage at banks and indicated the demand is coming from High Net Worth Individuals as well as institutional clients. They want an asset class that is uncorrelated to market returns. And most of these assets will only get real legitimacy amongst these large pools of money if they are offered via the big banks. And big banks will use their regulatory capture mechanism to convince regulators that crypto needs policing and banks should be the only way to interact with crypto-assets. On the day that this was given, JP Morgan had announced a coin for internal use. The RWRIer imagined a world with networks of banks and their blockchains which will eventually require a coin to interact in their networks. In order to do so, you&rsquo;ll need to furnish all your details. Ultimately, cryptoassets, he predicted, would lose all their anonymity and decentralized features.</p>

<p>Throughout the day there was meandering discussion about fat-tails. You want convex exposure to the fat-tails. They can be good if you are able to set up the right payoffs. What creates more convexity is the error rate of the variance. P(m, sigma plus delta) + p(m, sigma - delta))/2 is a different distribution than one characterized by P(m, sigma). Again the sum of the averages is not the average of the sums. And if our estimated means have large or infinite variance we can have very unexpected values in the tails. ((X + something) + (X - something/ 2) is higher than X. Again, this is known as Jensens Inequality. The expected probability of event steepens as the sigma increases. Visually, the mass under the tail increases as sigma increases.</p>

<p>When you operate in this kind of environment, one where the volatility is uncertain you have to think about a number of things in order to stay alive. The more volatile a commodity, the more convexity it exhibits. Under high enough variance, it matters less about the direction of the price and more about the variance. You can be right in direction and so wrong on variance that you get wiped out. If you are trading options and if the variance is high, is the convexity priced in?</p>

<p>In fact, the question should be something like, do you have enough evidence to suggest that your business is not highly volatile? Maybe. The pyschology required to operate successfully in this type of environment requires a mental stamina to be wrong all the time and still survive. If your business is trading you want 1000 plus trades of the same type and you want them all to be convex. This type of product, if you accumulate enough of them (1/n) you&rsquo;ll have enough to survive.  If they are convex, the payoff will more than overcome any previous loss form the other 1/n-1 bets.</p>

<p>We discussed the book publishing business as a representation of this idea outside of trading. Bertelsman basically owns all the small publishing houses. They have slowly accumulated 1/n bets with n being each book published each year. Since book sales exhibit a power-law, only a few will be profitable and many will be published. Therefore Bertelsman buys all the supply loses on most and makes a profit on few. Theatre/play financing and movie financing was another type of business. The analogy of bitcoin as a book was interesting as well. If the payouts exist as a power law you need to the law of large numbers to get you profitable. Can you buy all the cryptocurrencies? I think <a href="https://twitter.com/novogratz"><strong>Galaxy, Novogratz&rsquo;s</strong></a> fund is trying to do something like this. Taleb then made an interesting comment about precious metals miners as being a way to express your view on metals prices. They actually have the most optionality in them. I need to do some research on this to verify.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s discussions really drove home the importance of putting some structure around evaluating your risk and the consequences to your business of discrete risks emerging.</p>
