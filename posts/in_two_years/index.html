<p>An exercise posed today during the Udacity video.</p>

<h2 id="two-years-from-now-where-do-i-want-to-be-what-do-i-want-to-be-doing">Two years from now, where do I want to be, what do I want to be doing?</h2>

<p>Two years from now, I am trading for myself and I am very liquid with no financial doubts or concerns. I am location independent spending my time between Hawai&rsquo;i, Bali, and Tokyo/Singporae/Hong Kong/NYC/London. Everyday I wake up and sit my morning meditation. I then check the surf and check the markets, if the markets need attention, I spend time setting my positions. If there is surf, I surf after the market attention is given. If no surf, I train, do yoga, or other physical activity. After physical training is complete, I return to examine the markets. This takes me to late morning/early afternoon. Early afteroon I read, explore new ideas, meet friends, take meetings. The purpose of this is to connect with the new and the potential of life. After will be a 30-45 minute yoga or intense training session followed by preparation for the following trading day. During this evening session, I examine potential trades, update views on existing trades, and reflect on completed trades or missed trades. After this recovery and reset in the sauna and cold bath. Finally, the evening ends with meditation and letting go of the day.</p>

<p>When I am in the financial capitals of the world, I take the opportunity to sit down and talk to traders, investment professionals, and people with ideas about the direction of the world. These are very fruitful episodes with valuable exchanges and connections with old and new friends and collaborators.</p>

<p>We have the land, we are preparing it and the dwellings. The space is special. It radiates. The vibration is powerful and peace inducing. It brings clarity and sanity to your mind just being there. In year three, we will move to the land.</p>

<h2 id="one-year-from-now-what-do-i-want-to-be-doing-where-do-i-want-to-be">One year from now, what do I want to be doing? Where do I want to be?</h2>

<p>One year from now, I am working with world class trading professionals, improving my methods and techniques and building my confidence in my process and skills. My wealth is building. My confidence is building. I am based in a global financial capital with periodic breaks to trade remotely. I do this to model, practice and improve my discipline, habits and self-sufficiency for the future.</p>

<p>My trading is improving daily and my focus on this improvement is complete.</p>

<p>Training, yoga and meditation are a means to give my subconscious space to roam and connect the dots of trading. I am training jiu-jitsu 4-5 times/week with accomplished, knowledgeable and no-bullshit, no-ego professionals. I am training yoga 5-7 times a week. My body and mind are healthy, vital and energized.</p>

<p>We travel from time to time for inspiration but mostly to look at land. We are reminded of how much beauty and peace there is in the world.</p>

<h2 id="in-six-months-where-do-i-want-to-be-what-do-i-want-to-be-doing">In six months, where do I want to be? What do I want to be doing?</h2>

<p>Six months from now, my self-lead apprenticeship and learning is coming to an end. I The extensive reading, studying, practice and work I have done has led to a number of opportunities with people I respect and admire. I have a clear picture in my mind of the ways in which funds use quantitative methods in their trading. I have experimented and written code implementing many of these methods. I know which ones I believe in and which I believe do not yield results.</p>

<p>I am also clear on how I like to use discretionary trading. I know the instruments I like, the time frames I like and the types of trades that make sense to me.</p>

<p>I am still experimenting with ways to integrate these two systems and it is clear that this will be how I ultimately develop my edge over time, by drawing on these two distinct ways of seeing and solving problems.</p>

<p>My health is great. I am training jiu-jitsu and things are finally making sense to me. I am practicing yoga almost every day and I am very grateful for the strength, flexibility and adaptability of the body.</p>

<p>My sabattical is nearing its conclusion. I have learned so much about myself. I have learned how to motivate myself, without any outside force. I have learned how to build new skills and acquire knowledge in a more natural way. I&rsquo;ve also learned how to communicate and demonstrate those skills and that knowledge for others to use and understand.</p>

<p>My time abroad is coming to an end. My world-view and my sense of the future feel more connected to and informed by experience rather than abstraction, books and other non-experiental information. The places I have been, the conversations I have had, the people I have met and learned from have given me a new sense of the world. My stories come from the people I have met and the places I have been, the things I have seen, heard, smelled, and tasted. They are not from outside of this experience and in this way it is real.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-do-today-to-establish-and-strenghten-myself-on-the-path">What do I need to do today, to establish and strenghten myself on the path?</h2>

<p>On this path of discovery, I am evaluating two schools of trading: discretionary and systematic. I&rsquo;d like to know where my personality will succeed. My instinct says that it is somewhere in the middle but leaning toward discretionary with strong use of technology and systems.</p>

<p>To understand the discretionary I need to do this daily.</p>

<p>Look at instruments. Write down your views. Evaluate your views. Make a decsion one way or another. Take a position or sit on the side. Either way, justify your view. Reflect on the success or failure of the view.</p>

<p>To understand systematic, I need to do this daily.</p>

<p>Build a clear understanding of the procedures and routines used in large funds for systematic and algorithmic trading.</p>
