  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">RWRI 10 Day 1</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: These are notes written a few days after completion of seminar. My apologies in advance for any misapprehension of critical details. Also, to complement some of the lecture content, I&rsquo;ve added related content from other sources. Bold words are links.</p>

<p>Today was day one of the Real World Risk Institute. The RWRI is a 5-day course of managing risks in the real world, as the name suggests.
The course is led by Nassim Taleb. If you are not familiar with his ideas, you can learn more <a href="http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>My first contact with Nassim&rsquo;s ideas ocurred in 2012 when I read Fooled by Randomness and the Black Swan. Shortly after that he published Anti-fragile. In 2018, he published Skin in the Game. Nassim has influenced my thinking more than I realize at times. I remember not only reading his books but looking into the bibliography of the books to try to understand the process that led to his thinking. I later came to understand the process that generated his philosophy was trading and the words to narrate that philosophy came later. I suspect now that many of the books in the bibliography were simply his way of building the domain specific vocabulary to communicate his ideas to others in society. The books were not revelatory but rather affirmational.</p>

<p>From the beginning, it was clear this was about sincere knowledge transfer. Content, not cosmetics, was the value. In this spirit, Nassim indicated that no political correctness would be observed in the course. He would offend everyone equally. If you visit the site of <a href="http://www.realworldrisk.com/"><strong>RWRI</strong></a>, you will see that it does not look fancy. Nassim is betting that the content will overpower the cosmetics. Importantly, he suggests, you don&rsquo;t want to be involved in contracts/relationships where cosmetics trump content. So his consistency in his beliefs and actions is intact, certainly regarding the website.</p>

<p>Instead of doing any formal introductions, he simply enumerated a list of professions so we could see where the class was oriented professionally. I was waiting for him to ask about defense professionals in the room but he did not.  I came to learn later that one of the studens is CEO of a very large defence training companies. However, he did indicate that previously some of the team-members from SEAL Team 6 had attended. Nassim recounted guys from team the &lsquo;killed Obama&rsquo;. He did not seem to notice until the slip of Obama for Osama was pointed out. Maybe it was an honest slip. There was laughter throughout the room.</p>

<p>The main lesson that Nassim wanted us to understand is that x is not f(x). You may have learned infinite facts about x. That constitutes your knowledge of x. It won&rsquo;t really help you in the world. How do you operationalize knowledge of x. You need to understand how f(x) affects you. What happens when x is exposed to some force and how it affects you. Academia is devoted to studying x. It has provided us little understanding of f(x). Honestly, my belief about why the academic world studies x is the desire to command and control x. It is the mind/ego/man&rsquo;s conquest of nature and nature is x.</p>

<p>Nassim adviced us to start from the tail. Start from the extreme, the worst-case scenario, and determine how to avoid that. In this world, uncertainty/volatility/randomness is the base state of the world. In such a world, it will become very clear what not to do. This is the Via Negativa. You will see what classes of behaviors must be removed as they are the sources of potential ruin. Almost verbatim, Taleb stated, &lsquo;If your strategy has no plan to handle tail risk, it will eventually fail.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Which brings us to the idea of Ergodicity. This is an idea from statistical physics that Taleb applies with a nuance. The idea is something like it is wrong and ruinous to apply ensemble probabilities of an action to those of a single actor through time engaging in the action. I think the main insight here is the time dimension. If you as an actor in some game with probability of ruin of 1/x and you play the game x times, by definition you will be ruined. So from the above paragraph, if you are playing a game with a certainty of ruin and you are not employing a strategy to prevent that then you will eventually go bust. Taleb&rsquo;s sense of path dependence is simply that if you went bust, you don&rsquo;t get to play any more games and so the probabilities assigned to different outcomes don&rsquo;t actually mean anything. If at some point you could go bust there is nobody to show up to take the next bet.</p>

<p>This is one side of ergodic and it is the most intuitive. There is another intent that Taleb uses in the book Skin in the Game. Again it has to do with ensemble probabilities and the time dimension and how it relates to inequality. Say you have some wealth distribution for a given society in with 65% in lower middle class, 10% in upper middle class, 24% in middle class and 1% in upper class. In such a world:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Perfect ergodicity means that each one of us, should he live forever, would spend a proportion of time in the economic conditions of the entire cross-section: out of, say, a century, an average of sixty years in the lower middle class, ten years in the upper middle class, twenty years in the blue-collar class, and perhaps one single year in the one percent.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Taleb, Nassim Nicholas. Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life (p. 132). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.</p>

<p>This insight is very non-intuitive.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Static inequality is a snapshot view of inequality; it does not reflect what will happen to you in the course of your life.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Taleb, Nassim Nicholas. Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life (p. 131). Random House Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.</p>

<p>Just as the probability of any given trade may ruin you, you have a 1% chance of entering the highest echelon of wealth. If given enough time you will. This is a highly encouraging thought.</p>

<p>More on the subject on wealth distribution and outcomes. Taleb made the statement that you could get a Jeff Bezos type person on the wealth distribution from the people sitting in the room. Surprisingly, even if you removed the wealthiest person from the ensemble, you could still reach such an extreme value. Within extreme value theory the tales can be so extreme as to massive dwarf all other observations.</p>

<p>Random does not look random. This idea still sits in me and makes me dizzy. Taleb speaks about the ludic fallacy: how we observe randomness but construct a narrative anyway. He used epidemiology to demonstrate this. Using random data, and a spatial grid, he demonstrated that observations will naturally cluster. Every time you reset the randomizer, a new data set is generated and the clustering reappears in different ways in different grids. If the observations were incidence of disease and the spatial grid an actual location you could make the case that something dangerous was happening in those grids with the clusters of data points. Nassim, indicated that certain types of lawyers understand this and in fact go around to different companies in certain locations with high incidence of disease and perform a kind of extortion on those companies. He recounted another version of this idea from the perspective of a natural resources consultant. The consultant works with exploration companies and only gets paid if his advice leads to the discovery of minerals. If the distribution of natural resources has this kind of random natural clustering then the consultant really has no downside. He just picks an area randomly and he just knows that sometimes, he won&rsquo;t get paid, and sometimes he will look smart, get paid and the client will get paid even more. That story sounds almost apocryphal.</p>

<p>Correlation is not correlation. This is an extension of random does not look random and a riff on correlation is not causation. If you&rsquo;ve never seen <a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations"><strong>Spurious Correlations</strong></a> then its a good starting point to start to undermine your confidence in classical statistics. At the time of the seminar there was a public debate between Taleb and some other public figures about IQ. The insight that &lsquo;correlation is not correlation&rsquo; is that you cannot even make a strong claim that IQ and performance, and by extension wealth accumulation. The argument rests on the number of variables that affect performance and wealth accumulation and the curse of dimensionality that accompanies such analysis. The technical discussion is <a href="https://medium.com/incerto/iq-is-largely-a-pseudoscientific-swindle-f131c101ba39"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Randomness and barbells. I am a weightlifter and have been since high school. I love it. I have read so many books and tried so many systems. In 2017, looking for new ideas, I trained with <a href="https://thehappybody.com/"><strong>Jerzy Gregorek</strong></a>, a Polish Olympic weightlifter with some world titles and some unorthodox methods. I was curious about Taleb&rsquo;s thoughts on weightlifting since he makes frequent reference to deadlifting. So I approached and asked him if he&rsquo;d heard of Jerzy and what his thoughts on ratios of body mass to lifting capacity are. Incidentally, he did not seem too interested because he pulled out his phone during our conversation. However, randomly and almost inexplicably, he&rsquo;d received a text from <a href="https://startingstrength.com/"><strong>Mark Rippetoe</strong></a> as we were chatting. That was random.</p>
