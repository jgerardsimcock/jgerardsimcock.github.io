  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">Factor Analysis</h1>
  <div class="content">
    

<p>I&rsquo;ve just completed Term 1 of Udacity&rsquo;s AI for Trading Nanodegree program. This is not a review of the course content. This is a review for my own benefit of the some concepts that I need to work with and better understand. My verbal characterization of my understanding of these concepts will be crude, imprecise and potentially wrong. This is a work in progress.</p>

<h2 id="factor-models">Factor Models</h2>

<p>The origin of Factor Model is the French/Fama three-factor model. In this model they used &lsquo;factors&rsquo; like market-capitalization and growth.</p>

<p>Factor models having explanatory value for risk/returns. For each factor and asset in a factor model, there is a Beta coefficient that indicates the sensitivity of a particular asset to a given factor. Factor models also include the security specific alpha and security specific noise/error or other behavior not capture by factor.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; approach to factor models is to use &lsquo;observable&rsquo; factors. However, with methods like PCA and deep learning, there are factors that are latent or unobservable, at least to humans.</p>

<p>Factor models using observable factors. PCA seeks to identify, latent non-observable factors. PCA as dimenstionality reduction. PCA for highly correlated data.</p>

<h2 id="factors">Factors</h2>

<p>My current understanding of a factor is something to contributes to return behavior for some defined period. For example, if the price of an asset has gone up/down quickly over a period we can say that momentum is a factor that contributes some percentage to overall returns. Another example would be the market cap of company. We could say that the size of a company, its market cap, contributes some amount to the overall return.</p>

<p>There are several types of &lsquo;observable&rsquo; factors that can be considered.</p>

<ul>
<li>Value: i.e price to book, price to earnings, dividends, and free cash flow</li>
<li>Size: i.e large cap vs small cap</li>
<li>Momentum: returns from the recent past will continue for some period forward</li>
<li>Quality: low debt, stable earnings, consistent asset growth, and strong corporate governance, return to equity,
debt to equity and earnings variability</li>
<li>Volatility: i.e. standard deviation of returns over some period</li>
</ul>

<p>These methods can be reasoned about by humans. With a sufficient amount of time and education, they make sense to us. With PCA and deep learning the latent factors are not obvious or meaningful to humans.</p>

<h2 id="time-series-and-cross-sectional-models">Time Series and Cross Sectional Models</h2>

<p>Cross-sectional models allow you to perform analysis on assets in a similar industry, country or other grouping at a given point in time. Time series models allow you to perform analysis on heterogenous types of assets through time.</p>

<h2 id="pca">PCA</h2>

<p>Principal Component Analysis is a way to take a matrix and decompose it a new set of matrices. In linear algebra, we used eigenvectors as as a way to find a new basis for the system that maximized the variance among the points. With PCA we are finding the basis that maximizes the variance.</p>

<h2 id="risk-factor-models-using-pca">Risk Factor Models using PCA</h2>

<p>PCA is used in risk modeling so that we can identify the principal components with the greatest variance. We also decompose our returns matrix into factor_exposure and factor_returns matrices. This allows us to identify latent source of alpha and risk. We can then model each of these latent variables return profiles to see how a given assets exposure to the factor affects its return for some period.</p>

<p>We can reallocate our weights to separate assets based on potential risk/return profiles for a given factor/asset pair. And we can update this as we move through time so if we estimate that the risk of a given factor has increased and one of our main positions has a high exposure for that factor, we can reduce or exit our position. Similarly if the returns of a given factor are going up we should increase our position for a given asset.</p>

<h2 id="alpha-factors">Alpha Factors</h2>

<p>Alpha Factors are things that contribute to alpha. Many are a function of price and volume. Some can come from alternative data. Some can come from fundamanetal data produced by the company. In this way, it is a bit of a blend of the traditional technical vs fundamental. Its power is amplified with the use of machine learning and large-scale computing to identify signal in large data sets.</p>

<p>In our final project we worked with a number of alpha factors like 5 day price mean reversion, 1 year momentum, overnight sentiment.</p>

<h2 id="researching-alpha-factors">Researching Alpha Factors</h2>

<p>Examples of research papers and the process of turning papers into alpha factors</p>

<p>How Risk models and Alpha models interact</p>

<h2 id="evaluating-alpha-factors-by-quantile">Evaluating Alpha factors by quantile</h2>

<p>We took the quantiles of our daily factor returns to see how we would possibly implement a strategy using the factor. Low negative daily returns would be opportunities to short and high positive daily returns would be opportunities to go long. Evidently, we want our daily returns to be monotonic in there quantiles. For our project, many of the alpha&rsquo;s generated signal on the short side. This is sub-optimal since you need to find the stock to short and it can be expensive to short. Finally, the daily average return for many of the alphas was around 3 basis points. That&rsquo;s pretty small. Annualized that is roughly 7.5%. If you include transaction costs that can further reduce your return. The point is, that many of these strategies only make sense under leverage and because of this are only suitable for institutional investors.</p>

<h2 id="turnover-analysis-factor-rank-autocorrelation">Turnover Analysis: Factor Rank Autocorrelation</h2>

<p>To understand the stability of the alpha factors, we can do a test to see how frequently our alphas shift in their respective rank vis-a-vis other factors. This will also help us understand potential trading costs for system built upon a set of alphas.</p>

<h2 id="sharpe-ratio-of-alphas">Sharpe Ratio of Alphas</h2>

<p>Sharpe ratio is a measurement of how much volatility you should expect for a given expected return. Many investors are uncomfortable with high volatility. Values of 1 and higher are good targets for a sharpe ratio. We smoothed our factors to remove some of the volatility. These volatility reducing transformations did not seem to affect Sharpe Ratio that much.</p>

<h2 id="combining-alpha-factors">Combining Alpha Factors</h2>

<p>We have a bunch of alpha vectors corresponding to different alphas and each of these vectors has a unique coefficient associated with each asset. So how to use them? You combine them somehow to get a composite alpha vector and this will tell you what to do on a give day for a given asset. In our project, we just took the average among the alphas and created our combined alpha vector.</p>

<h2 id="portfolio-optimization">Portfolio Optimization</h2>

<p>We have constructed an alpha model and a risk model. So we want to construct a portfolio that tracks as close as possible to the objectives of these two models.</p>

<p>It is certain that we will face constraints on portfolio construction. At the least, if we are market neutral, we need to make sure the sum our weights is zero. There will also be risk constraints and factor exposure constraints for each asset.</p>

<p>We use a library called cvxpy to optimize our portfolio. This libray allows you to define and minimize/maximize and objective function. It also takes a set of constraints under which to optimize. The outcome of this is that it allows us to know which stocks to put positions in. It defines a vector of weights for the portfolio for each stock.</p>

<p>We perform additional regularization constraints to increase the diversification of the portfolio. We update our objective function by adding a regularization term. The affect of this is to increase the weights for some factors and decrease the weights for other factors resulting in a more diversified set of holdings.</p>

<p>We perform a final bootstrap like optimization by trying to minimize the distance between our portfolio weights and the weights of an ideal index. Since we are not given a set of ideal index weights we perform a bootstrap by creating a weighting scheme that is proportional to the future returns for each asset.</p>

<p>This part of the process seems to be where the art of the process comes in. It depends on your mandate and it depends on your abilities regarding on what next step you&rsquo;ll take. You could do an infinite number of optimizations to meet the specific requirements of your mandate.</p>

<h2 id="lingering-questions">Lingering questions</h2>

<p>Its still not totally obvious to me how we are using the factor betas determined in the PCA risk model and the alpha factors. I see that we use the covariance matrix of factor returns from the risk model as an input into our constraints as well as using our factor betas to detemine our max and min for a given factor allocation.</p>

<p>But I am still not totally clear on how the factor betas and the portfolio weights are interacting.</p>
