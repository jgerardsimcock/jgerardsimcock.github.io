  <div class="content">
    <p>So many systems, masters, gurus, experts, programs, classes. So many people striving, pursuing, seeking. So much human energy into this question, this pursuit. Clearly there must be answers. Maybe. Maybe the answers found, problems solved are those of the seeker. Are they your problems? If not, how can they be your answers? Do you know what you are actually after? Do you know what you actually want? Or have you just settled for someone elses desires, someone else&rsquo;s problem, someone else&rsquo;s narration of their solution, some one else&rsquo;s system? <a href="https://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/#H2">Rene Girard&rsquo;s</a> idea of Mimetic Desire seems more true than ever.</p>

<p>Walk into the abyss, the desert the wilderness, <a href="https://www.jkrishnamurti.org/about-dissolution-speech">the pathless land</a>, as K would say. This is where the truth is, everyone&rsquo;s truth is. Although, what it may look like on the outside and how it expresses itself may have no consistency, no resemblance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the last few weeks training jiu-jitsu, training techniques in quantitative trading, and training at a strength gym. I am also currently working from a co-work space where life-coaches and online consultants are working.</p>

<p>What is the common thread? The whole apparatus of human effort seems to be something like, steal/copy/mimic the techniques of people who have figured something out for themself. I don&rsquo;t want to believe this but I am afraid it is true. I don&rsquo;t want to believe for a few reasons. One, its depressing to believe that so much human energy goes into people copying one another in an attempt to fulfill something missing in themselves. Two, its depressing to think that effort is wasted because they will fail until they look into themselves. Finally, three, it only seems obvious to me now that I have done one and two.</p>

<p>There is actually a fourth reason that I do not want to believe it. That reason is that if I do believe it then I must conclude a few other things: that the only real path is the one you walk alone, without a guide, except for maybe your relationship with God. Yes. God. And the other conclusion is that this is all that is left for me. And its scary to stare into the abyss of the pathless land.</p>
