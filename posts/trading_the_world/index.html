<p>Ever since I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812967267/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i4">Adventure Capitalist</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Investment-Biker-Around-World-Rogers/dp/0812968719">Investment Biker</a> the idea that you could use trading as way to express ideas about the world has really captivated me. Maybe that sounds like bullshit since I&rsquo;ve only really started to give real attention to it. So be it. No more. Now it is true and I am living it.</p>

<p>The ideas that I want to express are my views about the direction of geopolitical relationships as well as the monetary relationships between nation states. For some reason, I like it. Perhaps it is because it strikes me as the greatest game.</p>

<p>Some general questions that have come up that I am researching. As I go through these questions I am trying to identify discrete trading opportunities along the way as I incrementally learn the instruments and how they may or may not inform wider views on the market as well as geopolitical and monetary landscape.</p>

<ol>
<li>What, if any, is the relationship between market indexes and currencies?</li>
<li>If such a relationship exists, is it stable or has it changed over time?</li>
<li>What can we learn about the ratio between indices and currencies. For example, USD/GPB vs S&amp;P/FTSE, USD/YEN S&amp;P/Nikkei, USD/HKD S&amp;P/Hang Seng.</li>
<li>I want to be able to trade China/Russia/US/Mid-East volatility but I do not know how yet.</li>
<li>I want to trade US volatility but I do not know how yet. What do I mean by volatility?</li>
<li>I mean the shifting relationship and political uncertainty between US/China and US/Russia and closer ties between Russia and China and other nations.</li>
<li>How can I trade geopolitics reliably and systematically?</li>
<li>How can I trade China?</li>
<li>How can I trade interest rates?</li>
<li>How can I trade LIBOR, EURIBOR, HIBOR, SHIBOR?</li>
<li>What do the relationships between the interbank rates mean?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between the interest rates and the market indexes and currencies?</li>
<li>What role does Japan play in all this? What role does the Yen play?</li>
</ol>

<p>Other questions that I want to understand from a long-term prospective is mostly about discrete opportunities from small-cap and family-owned, owner-operated business that may have some shares on exchages around the world. Frankly, this is not my original idea. It is an idea presented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4_U6bS-cU4">Tony Deden</a> in an interview on <a href="https://www.realvision.com/tv/home">Real Vision</a></p>

<p>Here are some recent trading ideas I have had.</p>

<h1 id="gold">Gold</h1>

<p>With all the recent market volatility, I am watching gold closely.</p>

<h1 id="usd-ruble">USD/Ruble</h1>

<p>This is some analysis I did yesterday.

<p>And today&rsquo;s (<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/USDRUB/uNwgVkQv-Short-USD-Ruble/">link</a>) update with entry, stop and take profit levels</p>
