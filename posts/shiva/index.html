<p>In Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva, is known as the destroyer. As a westerner, my mind immediately draws up dark images of violence,chaos, and bedlam. Shiva is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva">&lsquo;Supreme Being that creates, protects and transforms the universe&rsquo;</a>. So clearly there is more to this idea than simply destruction.</p>

<p>So what is the connection? It was not obvious to me until recently and I still have not fully apprehended the significance. Nevertheless, a quote by <a href="http://www.rumi.net/about_rumi_main.htm">Rumi</a> has helped clarify things a bit:</p>

<h5 id="your-task-is-not-to-seek-for-love-but-merely-to-seek-and-find-all-the-barriers-within-yourself-that-you-have-built-against-it">Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it</h5>

<p>It is as if, imagine, when you want something from the universe, you request assistance from something like a Shiva to destroy all that is not that which you seek. In this way, Shiva, or that thing from which you seek help, creates and transforms the universe. As I meditate on Rumi&rsquo;s quote, it strikes me as being fundamentally true. Anything we seek is ther waiting for us. It really is, even in it&rsquo;s simplest from. We see the vision in our minds, we think about it all the time.</p>

<p>What separates you in this moment from you in the vision? An entire landscape of excuses, bad habits, self-limiting thoughts, outdated ideas, unhealthy relationships and the lack of courage and honesty to live your vision.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been recently meditating with a kind of mantra similar to this Rumi quote. The intent is to simply destroy all that is not the vision in my heart, to remove all that is not the vision, the truth I seek to embody and live.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve been meditating on this, I&rsquo;ve also been reading some Jordan Petersen. He&rsquo;s got some interesting things to say about making sacrifices to God and how Cain and Abel represent that whole process. According to Petersen&rsquo;s interpretation of the bible, Cain was bitter and resentful to God because even though he was making sacrifices, God knew it was not Cain&rsquo;s highest possible sacrifice. And because of this unwillingness to sacrifice for the highest ideal God had favored Abel over Cain. Petersen&rsquo;s interpretation is something like, the universe, God, your own subconcsious, whatever it is, knows whether or not you&rsquo;ve truly sacrificed what you value the most to achieve your highest vision. Petersen suggests that maybe whats holding back our evolution, success, the favor of God is our unwillingness to truly give up what we value most now for the vision we value of the future.</p>

<p>As I think about this and I let it have idea offspring with the quote of Rumi, and the idea of a Shiva-like power it starts to crystallize. That barrier to the thing you seek is the thing that you are unwilling to sacrifice. You are unwilling to sacrifice because of fill-in-the-blank excuses. And because you have not sacrificed, you have not destroyed that barrier, you have not received favor from God, you have not attained the highest vision you seek, Shiva has not transformed your old universe and created the new universe of your vision.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s clearly more than one discreate thing, it&rsquo;s the entire apparatus of behaviors and habits you cling to that give you false security and a sense of who you are. And the process for letting those go can happen gradually or all at once. It is really up to you.</p>

<p>Doing something drastic is the all at once method. When I went through bootcamp, you become a different person. It&rsquo;s not bullshit. You don&rsquo;t have access to all the things that made you &lsquo;you&rsquo; before. Those habits are broken. The mental patterns are there for sure, undoubtedly. But its also certain that entire sets of behavior are being acquired while other sets are being discarded. Unfortunately, the all at once method, is generally not the one people choose. And it is unfortunate because we persist in a state of separation, from our highest purpose, potential and the vision in our hearts.</p>

<p>So maybe the next question after we have come to see the truth of the Rumi quote is what can I do to remove the barriers between myself and the thing I seek.</p>
