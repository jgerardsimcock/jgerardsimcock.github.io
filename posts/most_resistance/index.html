  <div class="content">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been listening to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidgoggins/">David Goggins</a> new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/B07KKP62FW/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1544880253&amp;sr=8-1">Can&rsquo;t Hurt Me</a> over and over again. There is something in the his reference to the path of most resistance and the spiritual and mental growth and abundance that lies on that path. I am sorry if that sounds like a bullshit line. But really, all abundance lies on that path. Material wealth, sure. There is also the wealth of energy and unknown that sits along that path. You have no idea where that path will lead you, yet you know the energy and curiosity and purpose is there to propel you with each step. The resistance part comes from yourself. Your fear, your resentment, your self-alienation, your doubt, your internal stories, all the bullshit you tell yourself. It&rsquo;s all there drawing you away from taking the next step, seducing you into the complacency of the known and comfortable.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how this bullshit, this nonsense in the head often/always feels and seems more real than taking the next step into the abyss, into the fight against the resistance. Until you realize you are running out of time. And that there will be regrets and what ifs and things left undone. So you stare at the paths that lead in front of you. One of them surely is the path of most resistance. The other is surely the paths of most regret.</p>
