    <p>Hello Friends at Hayman Capital,</p>

<p>This is an inquiry aboutemail to inquire about an apprenticeship at Hayman Capital. I&rsquo;ve been following the work of Hayman Capital for a few years. I am a Real Vision subscriber and as I&rsquo;ve watched the interviews with Kyle Bass, I&rsquo;ve only become more interested in the work the team at Hayman is doing.</p>

<p>My request is for consideration of a 90-day unpaid apprenticeship with Hayman Capital. Practically, what I can offer is technical acumen in python, data science and data engineering. Also, given the strong focus on China, I have lived and worked in China and understand the language, the people as well as the political, social and economic system. Finally, I&rsquo;d like to believe, I&rsquo;m the kind of the guy you want in the foxhole with you when things go pear-shaped.</p>

<p>At the end of the 90-day period, both sides have the freedom to consider the merits of continuing the relationship. This is my request.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far, I am grateful.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Justin Gerard Simcock</p>

<p>Hello Friends at Hayman Capital,</p>

<p>This is an  inquiry about an apprenticeship at Hayman Capital. I&rsquo;ve been following the work of Hayman Capital for a few years. I am a Real Vision subscriber and as I&rsquo;ve watched the interviews with Kyle Bass, I&rsquo;ve only become more interested in the work the team at Hayman is doing.</p>

<p>My request is for consideration of a 90-day unpaid apprenticeship with Hayman Capital. Practically, what I can offer is technical acumen in python, data science and data engineering. Additionally, given the strong focus on China, I have lived and worked in China and understand the language, the people as well as the political, social and economic system. Furthermore, I am currently based in Bali, Indonesia on a learning sabbatical. If you need boots on the ground for your current South East Asia trade, I am that man. Finally, I&rsquo;d like to believe, I&rsquo;m the kind of the guy you want in the foxhole with you when things go pear-shaped.</p>

<p>At the end of the 90-day period, both sides have the freedom to consider the merits of continuing the relationship. This is my request.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far, I am grateful.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Justin Gerard Simcock</p>
