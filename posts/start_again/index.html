  <div class="content">
    <p>In the twilight of my temporal youth, I decideded to start over. In some ways, I feel that my life has just started.</p>

<p>When your mind is consumed with something, not doing/living that thing is a kind of painful dishonesty. My relationship with pain is perhaps different than most folks. I don&rsquo;t like pain that leads to regrets. I welcome pain that leads to freedom, awareness and peace.</p>

<p>So enough bullshit.</p>

<p>In late October 2018, I resigned from my job and decided to refocus my life. I was living in Hawaii, earning good money, with lots of autonomy, and a very high quality of life.</p>

<p>But the world was calling and there were parts of myself that I needed to develop and explore and bring into existence. I&rsquo;ve been peering from the outside into financial markets since I was in University. For one reason or another, I never felt it was right to participate. There were always &lsquo;more important&rsquo; things to do. When that statement no longer held true for me, there was only one option left.</p>

<p>It is very liberating state to know that there is nothing else you want to do. To spend my time thinking about markets, investing and growing wealth finally feels right.</p>

<p>The approach I&rsquo;ve taken is a bit unorthodox. In some ways, this is the only way I know to do things. It&rsquo;s raw, clumsy, and ungraceful at first. I&rsquo;ve relocated to Bali to preserve capital, continue to surf and train. Also as Bali is a hub for digital nomads I wanted to see first hand what their version of reality and its future was.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been on the ground for a few days now. I&rsquo;m working from <a href="https://www.dojobali.org/">Dojo Bali</a> and training at <a href="https://www.balimma.org/">Bali MMA</a>. I wanted my life to be simple. I want to travel no more than 10-15 minutes to the place where I will work or train. So I am living in Canggu and so far I am stoked. There is even a good couple of surf breaks within 100 meters or so of Dojo Bali so I can get in dawn patrol session, shower and start working. Seems like a good start.</p>

<p>What I am doing all day is learning about markets, trading and how to use computers to trade. I&rsquo;ve signed up for <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880">Udacity&rsquo;s Artificial Intelligence for Trading Nanodegree</a>. It begins next week. This week I have been busy going over linear algebra. Its been a few years and linalg always is a challenge for me.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t plan to post code here. I only plan to post links to repositories or projects I am hosting elsewhere. The purpose of this will be to reflect and share the fruits of the process.</p>
