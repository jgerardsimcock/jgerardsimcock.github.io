<p>Bitcoin price has an infinite mean and infinite variance
Two kind of stupid. Those who are saying its going to zero and those who say its going all the way up.

If you have a process, there is an infinite mean. You can take variance off of discrete events of the process.</p>

<p>Complexity and Agent based systems.</p>

<p>Computation: Cellular Automata
Computational equivalence
All processes in nature are recursions
All processes in nature can be viewed as computations
At its deepest levesl the universe is discrete
Systems can be described in terms of simple local equivalence
Computational irreducibility. You have to go through every step to get from a to z.</p>

<p>Cellular automata
Regular grid of cells, each one in a finite number of states.
Cellular Automata capable of complex, purposeful behavior
CA will produce semi-regular, seemingly intentful behavior.</p>

<p>Wolfram found 4 basic classes of CA
Class one, everything converges to all black
Class two, convergence to stripes
Class three, Random states but locally recognizable structures.
Class four, Complex structures, interact in apparently unpredictable ways, computationally irreducible system.</p>

<h2 id="rule-110">Rule 110</h2>

<p>The only way to determine future state of computationally irreducible system is to evolve it through all its intermediate states
Turing Complete</p>

<p>What does it mean?</p>

<p>Discrete vs. Continuous.</p>

<p>Population is modeled as differential equaiton
We can use a logistic to get the population growht rate</p>

<p>with values of r shifting we can observer that as r will produce different population states.</p>

<p>Lorenz Weather System
Seemingly tiny differences in initial conditions diverged wildly over time</p>

<p>Recursive structure in genetics
Each cell will decide what to be based on the cells near it.
It is strikingly simple. Each cell can produce system-level complexity. From the repetition of recursive structures, emerges complexity.</p>

<p>Self-similar behavior, randomness, and fractals, the simplicity</p>

<p>Agent based models and the computational universe</p>

<p>ABM is simulation of collective behavior arising from interactions of autonomous agents
Agents are governed by simple rules and from this complex behaviours emerge</p>

<p>Ant colonies are ABMS but ants have little apparent coginitive capacity
Vernon Smith</p>

<p>Iterate into the future, you and iterate, we are in the infinite game, you iterate and learn your way into the next step
Looking for ergodic strategy,</p>

<p>Looking at collective neighborhood clustering, you can get segregated cities based on the individidual preferences.</p>

<p>ABMs and renormalizations. Illusion that supply and demand drives markets. What drives the market is the last order.</p>

<p>Parable of the Deszertularo</p>

<p>Stayers and Roamers
No long-term cultural dev without stayers
Infrastructure</p>

<p>No cultural exchange and development would stagnate
Little contribution to knowledge and infrastructure
WIthout Roamers, stayers would die off when oasis dries up</p>

<p>Without both, the desert people would die
Without stayers not dev or improvement
Without Roamers, settlements would be both isolated and destined to fail</p>

<p>Discrete, stochastic process, emergent behaviour from simple agents
Continuous top-down models, will break under real-world stress</p>

<p>Computational indecidability</p>

<p>Negative empiricism. Find the negative instance, you can prove that is wrong.
In real life, you understand the asymmetry.

<p>Cauchy vs Gaussian</p>

<p>Cauchy variance increases as sample size increases
Gaussian everything converges</p>

<p>Start with fat tailed distributions</p>

<p>180 years of market drawdowns
How can drawdowns be modeled and analyzed?
How stable is this aspect of performance?
What insights can we develop examining the drawdowns in an important market over an extended period?
Recovery from drawdowns requires larger returns than the loss</p>

<p>Market drawdowns.
if 20% is a drawdown, 75% of time in a drawdown state. More than half the time in a major drawdown.</p>

<p>Drawdown distribution
Simplest assumption is to assume that the return process consists of IID random variables
Using the Cauchy, we can look at pre-depression and post depression and the</p>

<p>Bagging from empirical plus tail events from theoretical.
No matter how screwed up the government</p>

<p>A good statistical estimator is one where you have large additions to the data, it will not affect the distribution.
Take the long historical view. Certain market characteristics are stable despite immense tech and gov changes
Market max drawdown is a higher state of time than most people think
Working model (markov model) of market max drawdowns, but no convincing model returns
Mistake to view Great Depression as outlier
Comparing US and UK markets, no evidence to suggest one</p>

<p>EVT</p>

<p>Risk management from Raphael</p>

<p>How does risk affect your business</p>

<p>Bitcoin</p>

<p>AML</p>

<p>Ergodicity and Fat Tails
Nonlinearity and Scaling: Avoid naive averaging</p>

<p>Extreme Value Theory: mathematical machinery that allow you to prove the estimator you want to compute the parameters to prove a fat-tail
Statistics is data plus assumptions
All statistical assumptions are based on underlying assumptions
You cannot blindly apply statistics. You must understand the assumptions behind your techniques.</p>

<p>EVT, theory allow you to uncover the behaviour of the tails of your data without requiring the distribution, given you are able to guess where the tail starts. IFF you can guess where the tail of the distributiong starts.</p>

<ol>
<li>The tail of almost every distribution behaves according to 3 different regimes</li>
<li>REgimes are governed by a single parameter, extreme value index gamma = 1/alpha</li>
<li>Gamma can be estimated using statistical techniques.</li>
</ol>

<p>Heavy tail regime: gamma is greater than zero/alpha is greater than zero (Frechet Domain)
examples are Pareto, Student distrinbtions, stable alpha distributions
The decay of these regimes is slower.</p>

<p>Light tail regime: gamma = 0, alpha is infinite, Gumbel domain
Exponential decay in the tail
Normal Distribution, exponential Distribution, Poisson.</p>

<p>Finite tail domain: negative gamma, alpha less than zero, Weibull domain
Any finite distribution</p>

<p>EVVT framework
Just two ingredients areneeded
1. An idea where the tail starts: k
2. A good estimator for the tail index: gamma hat.</p>

<p>The Hill estimator: (<a href="https://www.blackarbs.com/blog/asset-pricing-using-extreme-liquidity-part-2/12/11/2016">https://www.blackarbs.com/blog/asset-pricing-using-extreme-liquidity-part-2/12/11/2016</a>)
Works well only if the data are really fat-tailed</p>

<p>EVT methodology
Take the log of fat-tailed data, sum over k, where k is the number of obs in the tail</p>

<ol>
<li>Plot your data</li>
<li>Choose a threshold on data which defines the tail</li>
<li>Apply an estimaor for gammma</li>
<li>Repeat from part 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where does the tail start?</p>

<p>Convexity to fat tails
What makes fat tails fat tails results in density rising.
Small probabilities are convex to error rate
(X + something + X - something/ 2) is higher than X</p>

<p>(P(m, sigma plus delta) + p(m, sigma - delta))/2</p>

<p>change how the probability of event steepens as the sigma increases.
The mass under the tail increases as sigma increases
Do the whole distribution with uncertainty of sigma
Perfectly fat-tailed distribution is With two observations, Tons of obs at 1 value and 1 value at some extreme value
UNcertainty about sigma creates fat-tailedness</p>

<p>Uncertainty about volatility gives you fat-tails
You get the fat-tailed option price when you take an uncertain value for sigma</p>

<p>Feta cheese
What are your factors
cost of milk, shift the cost of milk due to uncertainty around price
You can see how fragile you how
Ergodicity, complexity, scalability
Real estate investment: interest rates up and down to see what happens to your business.
How big of an alpha do you need? Usually we use too big of a deviation.
A option on the Vix. Strike price, at ten, if vol goes up to 15 the price of option goes to 100, if vol goes down to 5 then the option
Change in volatility of options. Vix, options to increased volatility, sell the options.
Explosions in volatility</p>

<p>Error on error. alpha is error. alpha_2 is error on error.
Given your state of knowledge, it can be</p>

<p>CLT, in the limit, the sum of random variables becomes a gaussian</p>

<p>The stable distribution is the Gaussian</p>

<p>Nature exists between gaussian and pareto. Within species is gaussian, between species is pareto.
Nature has fractals but up to a limit. Because the earth is finite you have the gaussian process showing.
What is fat tailed? Cities, sales of books, Size of companies,</p>

<p>What is</p>

<p>Several hundred million dollars</p>

<p>The capacity used within a queuing system, for every part of the excess capacity, the time required to move through the system doubles.</p>

<p>Survivorship bias
You see survivors not losers and compute the average off the winners.
Rennaissance around for more than 20 years because they took the tails seriously
Bitcoin is it volatile?
Remove the volatile period of the log returns.
Plot the log returns. Plot the stable and the normal. The Normal distribution is not adequate but the stable is
Fat tailed processes have long periods of &lsquo;normality&rsquo; and the extreme excursions from normality drive the fat-tailed
For memoryless processes these rare events can happen sequently</p>

<p>From the empirical data
Once every three years, you can expect a loss of 40% or more. Given that you exceed that 40% loss what is the max you can lose.
The max you can lose is 44%</p>

<p>If you use the normal distribution then you are only estimating a 11 percent max drawdown once every 3 years.</p>

<p>What if you use a stable distribition. The theoretical drawdown is 65% once every 3 years you can expect to lose 83%</p>

<p>Which traders are losing money more often than they win but when they win they win way more. If you are not convex, then you cannot make money.</p>

<p>All cryptos, eth, ltc, xrp, btc have the same characteristics.</p>

<p>What are we doing, that is practical</p>

<p>As you raise the variance, the mean goes up.
Convexity bias. The more volatile the commodity, the more convexity. under high variance, forget about direction, think about variance
If its convex, is it priced in?
You have to have the mental stamina to be wrong all the time.
Its ok to be wrong, be wrong small.
You want a 1000 trades, and you want them all convex.
general policy of accumulating things of that nature. If doing so, does not kill you then its good.</p>

<p>publishing
books are profitable all owned by Bertelsman, lots of small publishing houses
Only a few make money, lots of books published, the book buyers buy all the source of supply.
this strategy is 1/n
Bitcoin as a book. Imagine lots of books. Big payoff when right, small loss when wrong. Risk sharing, theater financing, 1/n strategies.</p>

<p>Get to the law of large numbers, book business is based on tails. They don&rsquo;t care. you have to have 1/n strategy. Mines that have extraction costs. Buy miners.</p>

<p>How to Gamble if you must. The less correlated, the less bets you need. The more correlated, the more bets you need. When correlation gets to one you need infinite bets.</p>

<p>Extreme Risk Management
Dominant Factor Analysis</p>

<p>Lot of data means bullshit
Can hidden risks be quantified?
Not how much but where does the risk come from.
Hidden Risks:
Ex Post: hidden risk appears when observed losses exceed anything that could have been extrapolated from past perf metrics,
simply by using performance analysis tools</p>

<p>Ex Ante: ps</p>

<p>FoF Index, portfolio of hedge funds,
Sharpe ratio is totally inefficient as a risk</p>

<p>Optimizer is max(expected Return)/min(risk) the risk has two sources: hidden, measured. Since risk is hidden, it is hard to minimize.</p>

<p>Credit driven fund. Long AAA, short T-bonds, duration. You are sensitve to the spread between t-bonds and corporate bonds
nonlinear factor analysis&rsquo;</p>

<p>What is sensitivity to risk factors. Identify the risk factors. Evaluate your sensitivity to risk factors.
How nonlinear are your factors?
The upside and downside are completely different.
Fung-Hsieh 7 factor model misses large negative events.</p>

<p>Kelly Criterion methodology. If you optimize, you know how much uncertainty you have. You can invest in a way that is proportion that makes sure over the long run you optimize growth and never go bankrupt.</p>

<p>Prevents you from investing too much. Because proportional. As you make money, makes you take more risk. If you dynamically adjust expected return, it slows you down even more as you lose money. Double scaling up when winning, double scaling down when losing.</p>

<p>Good for gambler since they have finite bets. Any point in time, revise.</p>

<p>X is not F(X)
X is the market. F(X) is your exposure to the market. It is not easy to understand. If you make a lot of money you may bankrupt your competitors. F(X) convex or concave. If convex big gains, small loses. Concave then big losses, small gains.</p>

<p>Ergodicity
Kelly Criterion will violate academic beliefs</p>

<p>Fat tails. Probabilities. Payoff in the tail is what matters. How do you prepare for the extreme events.</p>

<p>Convexity. F(x) the more second order effects the less you care about the average. You don&rsquo;t take naive interactions and you see how they scale through time and volume of interactions.</p>

<p>Convexity at the level of model error. 1 + a rule. If you error rate is high it totally shifts your tails.
Understand where your error comes from.</p>

<p>That this barbarous pursuit is, in the progressof society, steadily declining, must be evident, evento the most hasty reader of European history. If wecompare one country with another, we shall find thatfor a very long period wars have been becomingless frequent; and now so clearly is the movementmarked, that, until the late commencement of hos-tilities, we had remained at peace for nearly fortyyears: a circumstance unparalleled (&hellip;) The questionarises, as to what share our moral feelings have hadin bringing about this great improvement.</p>

If you take the price and it goes stochastic then you will show that those comparitive advantages go away
Make the earnings stochastic to overcome  Convexity bias.</p>

<p>Seminar conclusions
The world is more fat-tailed then you think
Start with 1+alpha: Every pair Omega(A) affect on Mean, Omega(B) affect on Standard Deviation.
How far is 1+ alpha, 1 or 2 standard deviations. Exact payoff is 1 standard deviation
Better Convex than smart: Rather be a cook, rather than a chemist
Focus on F(x) not X
Measure on the extremes and not the mean
Mean Absolute Deviation, Standard Deviation
High returns, no volatility =&gt; short options (bad news), the calm before the storm
Capping the tail is cheap, buying out of the money is cheap, has exposure is cheap
1/n for Apollo/Zeus sake
Distance from worst is potent information: What puts me in ruin. What scenario wipes me out. How probable is the scenario.
Nobody blows up on known risks
Asymmetry in statement: You can rule out black swans but harder to rule out black swans
Low probability the harder to estimate
Options are convext to volatility
THe high water mark is not the high water mark. The Lucretius problem. The highest mountain is not the highest mountain
Vol is good, risk is not: heart volatility, high volatility the less the tail risk. Something that has survived under volatility, is information they can survive.
No Quantification of risk something is likely or not likely. Who cares if it is 10% possible
Don&rsquo;t optimize allocation
Correlation is nout only not Causation, it is not correlation
Correlation is independent
The box cannot measure itself: You cannot use a probability distribution to determine if an observation came from a distribution
What is the error
Good at measuring probabilities but not good at payoffs
Facts are anecdotes&hellip;except for tail events.
Only the hyperparanoid survive.
There is always a sucker and a suckee
If it makes sense, don&rsquo;t do it
Max estimates pop average better than sample averafge.
