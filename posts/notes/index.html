<p>Long 100 calls. Long 100 puts. Short 110 Call. Short the 90 put.</p>

<p>Long 100 Call. Short 110 call. 100.110 Call Spread</p>

<p>Long 100 put. Short the 90 put. <sup>100</sup>&frasl;<sub>90</sub> Put spread</p>

<p>+1 100p, -1  90P, -1 80P, -1 70P</p>

<p>Nonlinearity ends with the last strike. ML would fit sigmoid functions. Relu function. Sum of Relu function.</p>

<p>Composition of strikes</p>

<p>Short one option, long one option.</p>

<p>Inverse heaviside function</p>

<p>12 way 12 different strikes. option pricing, Compute the payoff. Count strikes short , count strikes long. If more long than short, you are safe.</p>

<p>Hueristic of Ed Thorpe and Option traders.</p>

<p>Nonlinearity captured through machine learning. Put time value on option.
Schwarz distribution. Smoothing operator. Sovalev. Diff eq. Komologrov
Finds sum on nonlinear function.
Calibration. How often you are right/wrong on your calibration.
Compute in payoff in expecation space
Payoff can be complicate. Payoff is complicated.
Every payoff can be expressed as sum of options. ML is the sum of</p>

<p>Rectified linear unit. Heaviside Function. Pay 1 if right 0 if wrong.</p>

<p>x(H(x))</p>

<p>Show a payoff function and price the options. You have one minute. This is the IQ.</p>

<p>Everytime you have an inflection point you have a strike.</p>

<p>Quantity is the change of slope.</p>

<p>Big Boob trade. If nothing happens. You are good.</p>

<p>With Fat tails, you have a lower probabilty of nothing happening, Pick your k.</p>

<p>They want their money back when they opened the fund because the clients are confused. Long volatility on volatitliy
Compute Expectation from a trade</p>

<p>Plot the exponential.</p>

<p>Take the histogram of f(x)</p>

<p>If f(x) is happieness of money, and x is money, then the distribution is</p>

<p>Kelly Criterion methodology. If you optimize, you know how much uncertainty you have. You can invest in a way that is proportion that makes sure over the long run you optimize growth and never go bankrupt.</p>

<p>Prevents you from investing too much. Because proportional. As you make money, makes you take more risk. If you dynamically adjust expected return, it slows you down even more as you lose money. Double scaling up when winning, double scaling down when losing.</p>

<p>Good for gambler since they have finite bets. Any point in time, revise.</p>

<p>Half-Kelly. Kelly trades are aggresive. Put half money in kelly trades.
Fortunes Formula. Thorpe Zimba book.
Ed Thorpe Beat the dealer.</p>

<p>What is the optimal strategy. Optimize cash flows over time.
Summarize in log function.
Long gamma.</p>

<p>Buy at 100, take profit at 110</p>

<p>X is not F(X)
X is the market. F(X) is your exposure to the market. It is not easy to understand. If you make a lot of money you may bankrupt your competitors. F(X) convex or concave. If convex big gains, small loses. Concave then big losses, small gains.</p>

<p>Ergodicity
Kelly Criterion will violate academic beliefs</p>

<p>Fat tails. Probabilities. Payoff in the tail is what matters. How do you prepare for the extreme events.</p>

<p>Convexity. F(x) the more second order effects the less you care about the average. You don&rsquo;t take naive interactions and you see how they scale through time and volume of interactions.</p>

<p>Convexity at the level of model error. 1 + a rule. If you error rate is high it totally shifts your tails.
Understand where your error comes from.</p>

<p>Arrogant is interesting. Narcissistic.</p>

<p>Asbestos ruined the insurance industry after 500 years. Insurance works well in Mediocrastan.</p>

<p>After market dislocation, reinsurance rates go through the roof. They handle</p>

<p>Reinsurance do not know shit how to price insurance. It will be expensvie after big events. Pay 1.35% of a building to insure it for a year.</p>

<p>First big blow up. Some securities. 1986. 30 year bond for 2016. Trading more expensive than one month out treasuries. Make money on carry. Who are the buyers. Japanese postal office bought a bond. Japanese people started following. Every bank was short and long that bond. Every time they short the Japanese bond, everyone in Japan buys it. A wall street group went to Japan to figure out what the fuck is going on. People who had shorted, all went bust.</p>

<p>Volkswagen, Porsche. Some shares not owned by Porsche. Subset of the firm traded more than the parent company. VW and Porsche.</p>

<p>With oil storage you think you have a squeeze.</p>

<p>Front contract no volatility, back contract in high vol. Geo or temporal arb.</p>

<p>Short asset with a delivery. Greeks rented every ship and all storage capacity. Obligated to receive and you do not know where to store. They want to</p>

<p>Who is the Fuckee in the trade. It makes so much sense to short since its a Ponzi scheme. Herbalife,</p>

<p>When in doubt do a little. When convinced, do nothing.</p>

<p>You are not paid by god by what makes sense, you are paid by humans by what they are willing to pay you.</p>

<p>Gaussian
What is the average standard deviation of something that is hifgher than some standard deviaton. As you go up and up you get closer and closer to the variable.</p>

<p>Power law
Average move that is more than 10% is 20% as you move to higher benchmark your probability of exceeding some benchmark</p>

<p>Because of fragility of things that like time, the distribution of the</p>

<p>Technology that has survived two thousands years has two thousand more to go.</p>

<p>K(alpha)/-1 + alpha
3 classes of distributions
thin-tailed
fat-tailed
expectancy increases as time increases.</p>

<p>Force of mortality is positive. Thing that can improve with time is Lindy. Family companies are Lindy. Memoryless</p>

<p>Positive memory: Lindy
Negative Memory: Humans
Memoryless: Constant life expectancy</p>

<p>Lindy is invariant to the way you define a technology. Converge to old technologies.</p>

<p>Empires and City States.</p>

<p>Phenomenology and statistics
There are so many things that we don&rsquo;t understand why it works.</p>

<p>Estimates of casualties as basis for decrease in violence.
Shadow mean of war vs sample mean
Arrival time of such things is also stochastics</p>

<p>H.T. Buckle</p>

<p>Nobel prize</p>

<p>That this barbarous pursuit is, in the progressof society, steadily declining, must be evident, evento the most hasty reader of European history. If wecompare one country with another, we shall find thatfor a very long period wars have been becomingless frequent; and now so clearly is the movementmarked, that, until the late commencement of hos-tilities, we had remained at peace for nearly fortyyears: a circumstance unparalleled (&hellip;) The questionarises, as to what share our moral feelings have hadin bringing about this great improvement.</p>

<p>How to think about this. Foundational principles
Alpha does not change.</p>

<p>How do you estimate the mean of a fat-tailed process, take the largest</p>

<p>Story of NIall Fergusons wedding. Invited to wedding because he was a hotshot. Stephen Pinker at wedding offers an correction.</p>

<p>The application of model error.
Error is linear. rare shows early
Error/risk: Missed significant model
Error: missed second order effects.</p>

<p>Health of average temperatures vs. average health of different temperatures</p>

<p>Convexity
Deficits
Lets assume they can compute the link between unemployment and deficits.
Jensens inequality
(Deficit(10) + Defict(8))/2
whenever you have a negative sensitivity to 1+a
You need to invest in all stocks to capture market so you need a position in all
Make shit stochastic
If you take the price and it goes stochastic then you will show that those comparitive advantages go away
Make the earnings stochastic to overcome  Convexity bias.</p>

<p>Seminar conclusions
The world is more fat-tailed then you think
Start with 1+alpha: Every pair Omega(A) affect on Mean, Omega(B) affect on Standard Deviation.
How far is 1+ alpha, 1 or 2 standard deviations. Exact payoff is 1 standard deviation
Better Convex than smart: Rather be a cook, rather than a chemist
Focus on F(x) not X
Measure on the extremes and not the mean
Mean Absolute Deviation, Standard Deviation
High returns, no volatility =&gt; short options (bad news), the calm before the storm
Capping the tail is cheap, buying out of the money is cheap, has exposure is cheap
1/n for Apollo/Zeus sake
Distance from worst is potent information: What puts me in ruin. What scenario wipes me out. How probable is the scenario.
Nobody blows up on known risks
Asymmetry in statement: You can rule out black swans but harder to rule out black swans
Low probability the harder to estimate
Options are convext to volatility
THe high water mark is not the high water mark. The Lucretius problem. The highest mountain is not the highest mountain
Vol is good, risk is not: heart volatility, high volatility the less the tail risk. Something that has survived under volatility, is information they can survive.
No Quantification of risk something is likely or not likely. Who cares if it is 10% possible
Don&rsquo;t optimize allocation
Correlation is nout only not Causation, it is not correlation
Correlation is independent
The box cannot measure itself: You cannot use a probability distribution to determine if an observation came from a distribution
What is the error
Good at measuring probabilities but not good at payoffs
Facts are anecdotes&hellip;except for tail events.
Only the hyperparanoid survive.
There is always a sucker and a suckee
If it makes sense, don&rsquo;t do it
Max estimates pop average better than sample averafge.
Impress the IRS not your boss</p>

<p>Option is freedom, freedom is priceless</p>

<p>The more precise, the reg the more arbtirageable</p>

<p>Shadow mean is not observed mean</p>

<p>Ergodicity</p>

<p>Regulatory capture is the business they are in. The rules are written to prevent you from competing with encumbents</p>

<p>Who is the Fuckee in the trade. It makes so much sense to short since its a Ponzi scheme. Herbalife,</p>

<p>When in doubt do a little. When convinced, do nothing.</p>
