  <div class="content">
    <p>The other side of this job hunt is the reality check and the uncovering of persistent but previously hidden personal patterns. One thing I noticed was how my mind shifts during these interviews. I enter a state of wanting to please people, wanting to be accepted. I&rsquo;ve seen it a few times now and even though it&rsquo;s not excessive externally, I sense it in myself. I am pretty please this and that. I am seeking approval. I am hoping quietly, silently that I will be liked, found suitable, agreeable, worthy of admission to the team. I am being honest but I am not being complete. I am compressing myself into some image of what I think the counterparty is looking for. I diminish myself and then when I am rejected I feel terrible.</p>

<p>It is a very very strange thing. I do not know any of these people. I do not know about their character, the things they&rsquo;ve accomplished, their strengths, their weaknesses, their failures, how they respond to failure, how they respond to success. I know nothing about what motivates them, what they are afraid of, what keeps them awake at night. I do not know if I can trust that they have the same values as me, even in the most general sense. They are almost worse than strangers. Strangers I can ignore and act indifferents towards them. These people we have to try and pretend that we both want to become something other than strangers. And I find that they get way more from me then me from them. It is a very bizarre feeling to reflect on how I run through this whole thing and then I get rejected and then I get upset about doing all of this for strangers.</p>

<p>While that is a problem, there is a bigger problem. I&rsquo;ve started to run this back through my memory to see how I&rsquo;ve behaved in the past. I ALWAYS do this. If I believe there is something to be &lsquo;gained&rsquo;, I minimize myself to be accepted, BY STRANGERS. And if I am rejected, I have seen how the next step in my &lsquo;evolution&rsquo; looks something like aquiring all the qualities, skills, attributes of someone who I imagine would have been accepted by those who rejected me. This has gone back as far as I can rememember. Certainly it happened after I left home for college.</p>

<p>Honestly, I remember it not really happening when I was younger. I strangely, feel I was more self-confident when I was younger even though I certainly had no &lsquo;accomplishments&rsquo; upon which to believe in. There was that natural state of self-acceptance that was there. As I have gotten older and moved about the world and sought opportunities with different groups of people I see myself morphing and shifting to be accepted. It&rsquo;s like the ego is simply this thing that shape-shifts and it will do whatever it has to in order to survive and be accepted.</p>

<p>Why I am I doing this? Well in the current situation, &lsquo;this&rsquo; refers to the behavior modification as well as the pursuit of employment with these firms. The first behavior is based in insecurity and lack of self-acceptance. Noticing this behavior will start to diminish its expression.</p>

<p>The second behavior is a bigger issue. Why am I seeking employment in a firm? Honestly, it serves two functions. The first is a place to learn and grow and refine my skill set, my craft, my trade. It is a place I can receive mentorship. I am trying to put myself in the environment most suitable for personal growth. This is sincere, serious and truly what I have been seeking for the past eight months. Second, I am trying to build personal wealth and earn money. I need to eat and pay rent and take care of basic essentials in the moment and I need to plan for the future. This is true and basic. However, it ignores the alternate path of trading my own money. The downsides of this path are that I will spend my own money as I learn and I will diminish my wealth before I start to rebuild it. The other downside is that I may not be in the in the best learning scenario. I think both of these are real possible issues. Along this path is so much fear but also so much personal growth. It may be the most treacherous in some ways but the most fruitful in others. This is the <a href="https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/most_resistance/">path of most resistance</a>. And it just may be that this is the path that all these rejections will deliver me to.</p>
