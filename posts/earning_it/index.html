  <div class="content">
    <p>Are you worth it? Have you earned the privilege? Do you know how to value and protect the thing you say you value and care about? What have you given up to prove that it matters to you? What have you given to deserve it? What is the state of your mind when you interact with the thing you claim to love? Have you prepared it? Have you purified yourself in the fire?</p>

<p>These are questions that have been coming to my mind. They began the last day I was working. I woke up, knew it was my last day, went surfing and felt that I had no right to recreate. I had not earned it. I had not done the work, the expulsion, exhaustion of some part of myself to necessitate the recreation.</p>

<p>For me the ocean and surfing have existed in my consciousness like a radiantly beautiful woman that I get to commune with in a powerful and creative act. Yes. It is almost like sex. It is in many ways superior to it. The grandest dame of them all for me is to commune with the ocean and surf in Hawai&rsquo;i.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is my relationship with women in general or just how I recreate. Nevertheless, I have never been able to &lsquo;use&rsquo; surfing to &lsquo;escape&rsquo;. It is only available to me when I am empty, when I have spent my energy working, struggling, producing the thing that I do in the world. I only know this through experience. In the past, I have tried, unknowingly, to escape in the ocean. No quarter given, the the magic is not available to me. My mind is on all the things I know I am avoiding, the things I am scared to do or making whatever bullshit excuse I have at that moment. Imagine spending time with your woman and you just are not there, your mind is on all the things you are supposed to be doing. Its just not fair to all participants and frankly its dishonest and cowardly. Just do your shit.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I &lsquo;had&rsquo; to leave Hawai&rsquo;i was because she told me to leave. She was unhappy with me. I had betrayed the magic. I had this persistent feeling like I had dishonored our relationship, that I had betrayed the contract by trying to take something I had not earned. I suspect, it is close to violating a woman who does not consent. I felt this. I also felt something like a slap in the face, like I was stealing from something to make possible my time in Hawai&rsquo;i this last year. It was like you give you and your woman an amazing trip around the world together and she finds out midway that you stole from other people to make it possible. She spits in your face and shouts: &lsquo;How dare you steal to make this possible. How dare you violate the honor of our relationship. How dare you betray our trust and the purity of our relationship.&rsquo; I felt that. It was intense.</p>

<p>Since I have been in Bali, I have not been in the ocean one time. This is unbelievable to me. I came here since I knew if I wanted to surf, it would be available to me. However, as mentioned above, I have felt that, were I to surf, I&rsquo;d not be available to it. There would be no magic. I have not earned it.</p>

<p>The surf calls me everyday. I see it there. I am there it in my mind. I want to be worthy for the magic. Time to get back to work.</p>
