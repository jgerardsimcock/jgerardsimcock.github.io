  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently sat a ten day silent meditation retreat. Here are some thoughts that continued to surface throughout the retreat.</p>

<p>Before I left I saw this quote by Rene Girard: &ldquo;The sickest ones are those who are overly concerned with the sickness of others.&rdquo; This struck me when I saw it because I admit being concerned with what I perceive as a sickness in the modern social landscape of America. It was implying that I was more sick than the targets of my criticism. What was my sickness?  I did not know and really I spent most of the first few days of my silence and meditation trying to mentally distance myself from the thoughts of those I consider sick. At that distance I could see all the negativity that was coming out of the sick people. Their negativity was sourced in fear and worry. Who knows where their fears and worries originated but I started to witness my attraction to this chaos and I slowly understand my sickness. In my mind somewhere, was some attraction to this negativity. A mind that feeds off the negativity of others is indeed sick. I certainly had no compassion for these people. I only saw their negativity and their sickness.</p>

<p>Thankfully, in the absence of persistent negativity, a vision and experience of a more beautiful and positive reality prevails in my conscience. So one of the disciplines that I want to improve on is guarding the sense door and really trying to limit the negativity I let in from the world of politics and society. Would you rather be surfing or looking at the news? Would you rather be exposing your mind to something positive or something negative. It was one thing to expose in order to test your inoculation and equanimity, as long as you know that is the purpose. It is something altogether different to seek any kind of productive input from a deeply polluted stream.</p>

<p>My mind had become polluted. This became clear. My filter had become overwhelmed with negativity. I started to think about the importance of living morally and its implications for my filter and perceptions. You could not compromise the moral foundation and hope to have clear perceptions of reality. In the most basic example, breaking the precept of no intoxication by becoming drunk or drugged immediately compromises the quality of decision making and perception. So I&rsquo;m back on the horse for full sila/morality again. So that means maintaining the five precepts. </p>

<p>I thought alot about violence in the context of sila/morality. Perhaps surprisingly, I find very little dissonance in my heart about the use of physical force because the volition behind that force is not violent. It is corrective. As long as my volition and energy does not come from negativity I feel at peace with the use of force. During one of the evening Dhamma talks, Goenka (the instructor) makes the case that certain states of mind are so gross and unrefined that you can only effectively communicate in similar ways. I am not using his justification as my license but I find this to be true. Words do not work when you have a mind totally consumed in negativity and darkness and which is unable to process information clearly. I think the sequence is something like I check my volition, check to see what the state of my own mind is, is there compassion, is there an awareness of what is best for the everyone in this situation, assess and act. </p>

<p>In the context of sila/morality and violence I was brought in my mind to a few of the jiu jitsu gyms I&rsquo;d been to that made me feel not so great. There was something about the place and I think I finally understand. One place was infused with negative vibrations. There was no purification as part of the practice. It was a business, not an awareness of the transmission of a tradition and path to self mastery. My reading of most schools of enlightenment and the path of self-mastery require a purification so that the teacher can know the students will wield the power they acquire in a way that benefits all beings. Without the purification, you are weaponizing powerful techniques. I will be more aware of the moral qualities of the teachers and instructors for any martial arts I do in the future. This includes yoga. </p>

<p>The silence and meditation are wonderful but how to bring the practice into the world? A comment that caught my ear this time was that any practice that works with the awareness of sensation on the body can be considered part of the path. I thought this may be the key. Yoga started to have a potential for me again. I also thought about Laird Hamilton and Wim Hoff and their use of breathing and the sauna/ice baths. The full body immersion in the ice intensifies and expedites the discomfort and bodily awareness. Putting the mind in that discomfort allows you to practice equanimity and witness the changing nature of the sensations. The same is true for Yoga and I wonder about other possible avenues. I think this may be a way to spread the dharma to people who cannot conceive of extended departure from their lives as an initiatory step. </p>

<p>The comment made me think of people like Goggins and Cam Hanes. I started to wonder deeply if their extended stays in the realms of discomfort had yielded the purification and equanimity that we witness. I also started to wonder if a guy like Hanes does not need to sleep so much because he has purified himself through all work. He has overcome so many sankharas/neurosis/complexes that he emits deeply positive vibrations and does not need as much sleep. I also wondered about Jocko and other extreme endurance athletes. </p>

<p>Similarly, there was a comment that the difficulties are either opportunities to repress your sankharas/neurosis/complexes/ and multiply those miseries or transcend them and be liberated. This shift in perspective, that the obstacle is the way, I think was my biggest insight. Those things that yield strong negative aversions are the fertile sources of your growth and self awareness. There are things that are particularly difficult for me. When I put my mind to them they are difficult only because they generate strong negative emotional responses and I don&rsquo;t want to do them. But I experienced many times over the course that sitting through the negativity and just watching and not reacting allowed it to pass and the negativity was definitely weakened as a result. So now I want to &lsquo;welcome&rsquo; the strong negative responses because I know my freedom is on the other side. 
There is something called bangha which refers to total dissolution of the body and is an almost euphoria-like state. I guess it is like the flow state or perhaps something similar to the dissolution that people experience on a psychedelic trip. I experienced this on my first retreat a few years ago and have not since. Goenka mentions that when this occurs it is very positive but will also unearth a deep sankhara/complex/neurosis. I had never heard this before and I was struck because some things did start to happen that I&rsquo;d never really struggled with before. It is like as a further reminder of the impermant state of reality, after any kind of progress you have to confront deeper challenges. To continue to move up you must go deeper as well to remove all the impurities of the mind. </p>

<p>One final thought on this path and its vehicle of transmission, the vipassana meditation centers. These centers are self-sustaining, existing on the donations of former students who seek to extend the gift into the future to future students. It is the pure transmission of the teaching. It almost brings me to tears to see that such a place can exist in the world. It may be the most beautiful human organization I&rsquo;ve ever encountered. It feels like this is the only thing worth working for, the maintenance and preservation of these types of institutions and the goal that this one supports.</p>
