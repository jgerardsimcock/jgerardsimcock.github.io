      <title>The Greatest Risk</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The greatest risk is not taking a risk&amp;rdquo;.
These words stimulated something in my mind to the question: What unknown hazards am I accepting by not taking the risks that sit in front of me? Honestly, the question certainly charged a kind of zero-fucks courage. There is not one moment when you are not facing the unknown hazards of reality. And if this truly sets in you realize you just have to go for it at all times.</description>

      <description>Just a few charts today. I have not taken any new positions. The ruble short trade did not go as expected. So I currently have no open positions. I am watching the following instruments for potential trades.

      <description>An exercise posed today during the Udacity video.
Two years from now, where do I want to be, what do I want to be doing? Two years from now, I am trading for myself and I am very liquid with no financial doubts or concerns. I am location independent spending my time between Hawai&amp;rsquo;i, Bali, and Tokyo/Singporae/Hong Kong/NYC/London. Everyday I wake up and sit my morning meditation. I then check the surf and check the markets, if the markets need attention, I spend time setting my positions.</description>

      <description>Ever since I read Adventure Capitalist and Investment Biker the idea that you could use trading as way to express ideas about the world has really captivated me. Maybe that sounds like bullshit since I&amp;rsquo;ve only really started to give real attention to it. So be it. No more. Now it is true and I am living it.
The ideas that I want to express are my views about the direction of geopolitical relationships as well as the monetary relationships between nation states.</description>

      <description>So many systems, masters, gurus, experts, programs, classes. So many people striving, pursuing, seeking. So much human energy into this question, this pursuit. Clearly there must be answers. Maybe. Maybe the answers found, problems solved are those of the seeker. Are they your problems? If not, how can they be your answers? Do you know what you are actually after? Do you know what you actually want? Or have you just settled for someone elses desires, someone else&amp;rsquo;s problem, someone else&amp;rsquo;s narration of their solution, some one else&amp;rsquo;s system?</description>

      <description>Agency, competence, sovereignty, independence, self-sufficiency, freedom. A bunch of words. Abstractions that point to something outside of you. Defined in some book or by some other human. Seemingly common short-cuts we use to transact with other humans and ourself. I&amp;rsquo;m concerned when I use these abstractions with myself to compel behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s actually not just these words. Its almost many words for many different behaviors and outcomes. Why do I need words and abstractions to marshall my resources to ends that I find meaningful?</description>

      <title>The Path of Most Resistance</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to David Goggins new book Can&amp;rsquo;t Hurt Me over and over again. There is something in the his reference to the path of most resistance and the spiritual and mental growth and abundance that lies on that path. I am sorry if that sounds like a bullshit line. But really, all abundance lies on that path. Material wealth, sure. There is also the wealth of energy and unknown that sits along that path.</description>

      <description>Since the UDacity course does not start until 12 December I decided to finish watching all the videos from 2nd Skies Forex. I also found a new tool; new for me at least. Trading View seems to aggregate the data feeds from a number of brokers and allows you to use their data and charting tools. Its a pretty great tool. You can even link your brokerage accounts so you can trade directly from the platform.</description>

      <description>Trading and markets have been on my mind for a very very long time. I first became very curious about trading when I read about Jim Rogers trip around the world in 2000. A few years ago I thought about trading and purchased a course from Chris Capre at 2nd Skies Forex to learn to trade. I never finished the course. I told myself I would go back and finish that course some day.</description>

      <title>Start Again</title>

      <description>In the twilight of my temporal youth, I decideded to start over. In some ways, I feel that my life has just started.
When your mind is consumed with something, not doing/living that thing is a kind of painful dishonesty. My relationship with pain is perhaps different than most folks. I don&amp;rsquo;t like pain that leads to regrets. I welcome pain that leads to freedom, awareness and peace.
So enough bullshit.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve landed on my site.
This is an experiment. This is where I am posting updates and ideas that come to me.
Where are we? How did we get here?
I am a world citizen, currently based in Bali, Indonesia. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my post-university years in Hawai&amp;rsquo;i and California with meaningful episodes in Beijing, NYC, Shanghai, and Bogota.
In my past, I have done many things to make a living.</description>
