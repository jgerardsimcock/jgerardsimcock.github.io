      <description>I recently sat a ten day silent meditation retreat. Here are some thoughts that continued to surface throughout the retreat.
Before I left I saw this quote by Rene Girard: &amp;ldquo;The sickest ones are those who are overly concerned with the sickness of others.&amp;rdquo; This struck me when I saw it becauseÂ I admit being concerned with what I perceive as a sickness in the modern social landscape of America. It was implying that I was more sick than the targets of my criticism.</description>

      <description>There are these moments I have in yoga when I am dying. It feels like death. I cannot breath. I am dizzy. My chest is pounding. I want to quit. I want to leave the room. I feel alone. I feel so terrible. I start to feel pity for myself. All of my attention falls into the chasm of my own pain and suffering. And not only that, I start to have feelings about that pain and suffering, I start to have negative feelings about the feelings.</description>

      <description>The question of where things come from is solved. There is no doubt about how to realize things in the world. What is needed is brought into existence in the world when it is needed. Until then it waits as potential. Until then, energy goes into the imagination and creation of what is to come. The relationship with this process grows stronger and stronger. It is the connection to this process that sustains life.</description>

      <description>I am my father&amp;rsquo; son.
For a very long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to accept this. My father was a complicated person. He was human, with good and not so good qualities. It is also the case that he was not around. As far as what part of me is from him and what is from my mom, it was always a bit of a process of elimination and some guess work.</description>

      <description>The other side of this job hunt is the reality check and the uncovering of persistent but previously hidden personal patterns. One thing I noticed was how my mind shifts during these interviews. I enter a state of wanting to please people, wanting to be accepted. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen it a few times now and even though it&amp;rsquo;s not excessive externally, I sense it in myself. I am pretty please this and that.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been back in NYC for about 6 weeks now. Things have not gone as planned. In many ways, I could not ask for more from the world. It forced a state of consciousness on me. I realized ex poste what kind of fantasy state I had created and that I was occupying. That state existed without sufficient contact with reality. In the past few weeks, I witnessed my states of consciousness fluctuate between confidence and its absence.</description>

      <description>What would it mean if I started my own trading operation?
I started to think about this question from a CTO&amp;rsquo;s perspective. I wanted to understand the types of systems I would need in order to execute this successfully. Having completed this Algorithmic trading program I had a sense of what kind of systems I may need.
Securities Database The first part I would need to build this business is a securities database that would collect the time series data in real-time and then later be used as the raw material for research.</description>

      <title>Notes on Parallelism and Concurrency</title>
      <link>https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/parallel_concurrency/</link>

      <guid>https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/parallel_concurrency/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a number of interviews in the past two months. I&amp;rsquo;ve got another coming up and in order to prepare I want to review some additional python, programming and computer architecture topics.
Concurrency in Computer science is when different parts or units of a program/algortihm can be executed out-of-order or partially out of order. The opposite of concurrent execution is serial execution where each part or unit must be executed in order.</description>

      <title>Cross Validation in Finance</title>
      <link>https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/finml_7/</link>

      <description>Cross validation is used to determine the generalization error of an ML algorithm. It is designed to prevent overfitting.
Cross-Validation in ML ML algorithms attempt to learn the structure of the data (training data) so that we can infer the same structure on unseen data (test data). Training and testing on the same dataset will yield very high levels of prediction precision. This is what file-lossy algos do. They can summarize data with extreme fidelity, yet have zero forecasting power.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Methods</title>
      <link>https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/finml_6/</link>

      <guid>https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/finml_6/</guid>
      <description>Chapter 6 is the beginning of the modeling chapters.
The goal of ensemble methods is to combine the predictions from several base estimators built with a given learning algorithm in order to improve generalizability/robustness over a single estimator. Ensemble methods help reduce bias and/or variance. They cannot reduce noise.
Averaging Ensemble Methods Build single estimators independently then average their predictions. On average, the combined estimator is better than the single estimator because the variance is reduced.</description>

      <title>Fractionally Differentiated Features</title>

      <guid>https://jgerardsimcock.github.io/posts/finml_5/</guid>
      <description>Motivation  Low signal to noise in financial time series due to arbitrage Standard stationary transformations like integer differentiation further reduce signal by removing memory Price series have memory because every value is dependent upon a long history of previous values Integer differentiated series, like returns, have a memory cut-off History is disregarded after a certain time window Once memory has been removed, sophisticated techniques to retrieve signal leads to false positives  Stationarity vs Memory Dilemma  Non-stationarity is a time series with an unstable mean In order to perform inferential analysis, researchers need invariant processes Changes in yields, returns on log prices or changes in volatility are invariant These transformations make the data series stationary while removing memory For signal processing, we rarely want to remove all the memory since the memory is the basis for the predictive model Equilibrium models need memory to determine how far price has drifted long-run expected value What is mimimum amount of differentiation that makes a time series stationary while preserving as much memory as possible?</description>

      <description>Chapter 4: Sample Weights
Sample Weights  Most financial time series literature and models assume IID processes Financial time series are NOT IID Overlapping outcomes for our labeling process will mean that our observations are also not IID We have overlapping outcomes when one period&amp;rsquo;s label and returns coincide with another intervals For a given time point t we may have several labels running concurrently. We need a some function to compute how many labels we have running per time step Uniqueness of label for each feature  Bagging Classifiers and Uniqueness  Assuming IID observations leads to oversampling In-bag observations will become redundant to each other and similar to out of bag observations Redundancy of draws makes the bootstram inefficient For RF, all trees in the forest will be similar copies of overfit decision tree Out of bag samples will be similar to in-bag samples but so out of bag accuracy will be overestimated You can put an upper limit on the number of random samples so as to reduce the chance of oversampling  Sequential Bootstrap  Resample sequentially until K distinct original samples appear What are we sampling here?</description>

      <description>Some review I did for a bunch of interviews with trading firms
Linear Data Structures Data structures like Stacks, Queues, Dequeues and Lists are called linear because the items are ordered depending on how they are added and removed. When an item is added, it will stay in the same location until it is removed. Linear Structures have two ends: a left and a right.
Stack Stacks insertion and removal logic is Last-in-First-out (LIFO).</description>

      <description>Motivation In chapter 2 we produced a matrix of financial features from unstructured data. Unsupervised learning algos can learn pattern from feature matrix. Supervised learning, however, requires that each row of feature matrix must be labeled with a target label column Y.
Fixed Time-Horizon method In finance, ML papers all used fixed time horizon method. However, time bars do not have good statistical properties. Labels are applied regardless of the state of volatility of returns.</description>

      <description>Notes from Chapter 2: Advances in Financial Machine Learning
Motivation Using someone else&amp;rsquo;s dataset means you will likely discover what is already known by other people. Ideally, you want to start with raw, unstructured data and process it to make it most informative to you.
Four Types of Financial Data Fundamental Data  Accounting data that is reported quarterly Information that is found in regulatory findings and business analytics You must confirm when data was released so that analysis uses information only after it was publicly available Backfilling data means assigning data a value even if the actual value was unknown at time Reinstating data means to amend previously issues data values Low frequency and extremely regularized.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1 notes for Advances in Financial Machine Learning
Backtest fitting make Machine learning in finance more difficult than some other areas of ML
Financial ML vs standard ML
Failure of Sysphus Paradigm Discretionary PMS operate in siloed systems. Collaboration is difficult for these professionals. They have their own approaches and idiosyncratic methods for investment decision making. This approach when applied to machine learning and quantitative trading does not work.</description>

      <description>These are notes from the book Listed Volatility and Variance Derivatives by Yves Hilpisch. Additional notes are available in the notebooks at the bottom.
Chapter 1 Derivatives Volatility and Variance Volatility and Variance Concepts  Realized/Historical Volatility: Standard Deviations of log returns of financial time series Instantaneous Volatility: Volatility factor for a diffusion process Implied Volatility: volatility that if you plug into BSM model will give you the market observed price of an option If you take the square of these values you get the variance of them Annualized Variance is the result of variance times 252, the number of trading days in one year  Volatility and Variance as asset class  VIX represents 30-day variance swap VIX trading began in 2004 VIX options begain in 2006 EUREX launched futures on EUROSTOXX50 in 2005 2010 VSTOXX index options created 2014 variance futures contract for EURO Stoxx 50  Vol of Vol  VVIX, VVSTOXX reflect 30-day expectations of volatility  Volatility Trading  Long VSTOXX Future: Hedge equity positions and hedge short realized vol strategy Short VSTOXX Future: Speculate mean reversion after vol strike, reduced vega exposure to long vega option portfolios Term Structure arbitrage: If carry trade possible, and contango, short front and long back month Relative value arbitrage: Trade against other volatility instruments Long OTM Calls: Market crash insurance Short ATM Calls: Expecting mean reversion after significant market volatility Long ATM Straddle: When VVOL is high, buy put-call with same ATM strike and if vol moves fast enough in one direction, you sell  Variance Trading  Long Variance Future: Variance is higher than expected.</description>

      <description>Ito Calculus Calculus is useful for continuous process that are diferrentiable at every point from 0 to t. If your process is stochastic and has random jumps and fluctuations, you can not take the derivative of certain points along that line. For stochastic processes this is true and Ito calculua is one way to perform integration.

      <description>After finishing the Real World Risk Institute I wanted to get some more knowledge about options pricing, how it works and how to do it in Python. I am grateful to Yves Hiplisch for his work on the book Derivative Analytics with Python. This is a practical and applied approach to valuing/pricing derivative instruments. The book also covers the theoretical foundations necessary to make the application of the ideas tractable. In fact, there is quite alot of mathematical notation in the text.</description>

      <description>For the past 4 years, I have been a subscriber to Real Vision. The content and interviews have sustained my &amp;lsquo;dream&amp;rsquo; about working in financial markets. Since leaving my job to focus on the markets full time, I honestly have not had time to really watch it. However, recently, they held a live traders workshop and since I happened to be in the United States, I attended. The event took place at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City.</description>

      <description>In the closing hours of the seminar we brought it all together with some conclusions and summary. Aphorism and poetry are information compression. It seems to be Talebs natural communication style.
 The world is more fat-tailed then you think Your model has errors of 1 + alpha. That error will drastically shift your Mean and Standard Deviation more than you think. See 1. How far off is your error is 1+ alpha, 1 or 2 standard deviations?</description>

      <description>In a continuation of my efforts to develop a sense of the markets and a macro view, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to understand the main dollar pairs, treasury instruments, metals and energy futures. BTC is somehow relevant, if for nothing else, as a bellweather of extreme sentiment on current regime.

      <description>I have been using TradingView to paper trade. For instruments for which TradingView does not possess a real-time data feed, you cannot paper trade. I have used some etfs as a way to expose myself to trading the futures contracts.

      <description>In Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva, is known as the destroyer. As a westerner, my mind immediately draws up dark images of violence,chaos, and bedlam. Shiva is also a &amp;lsquo;Supreme Being that creates, protects and transforms the universe&amp;rsquo;. So clearly there is more to this idea than simply destruction.
So what is the connection? It was not obvious to me until recently and I still have not fully apprehended the significance.</description>

      <description>I recently implemented one of Jack Schwager&amp;rsquo;s strategies for trading. It is called wide-ranging day and takes advantage of volatility in a given instrument. It took me a while to really understand what was happening and then to implement it. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted my notebook here
I feel more and more inclined to only pay attention to a few instruments. I&amp;rsquo;d like to really understand them and see how these instruments behave.</description>

      <description>On the ring, it was inscribed, &amp;lsquo;This too will pass&amp;rsquo;. So the story goes.
Yesterday a weight came down on my shoulders. It was heavy to live. I was upset about something and it was something I did not care about even a few weeks ago. It did not even exist in my world. It did not exist and then it did and then maybe it will stop existing. And when it did, I associated the thing with me.</description>

      <description>Today looking at copper and oil to get a sense of metals and energy. For both we are back around levels that we saw when Trump took offfice. I don&amp;rsquo;t know it there is any relationship. The bull market that followed his arrival has completely retraced and we are back to where we started.

      <description>After having completed the work for term 1 of the Udacity Nanodegree I felt I need some more solidifiation of the ideas. I did some searching for possible trading strategies to see how they used PCA. There are many actually. I did find one that uses PCA, technical indicators and machine learning on forex. This is like the golden sweet spot for me. Here is that notebook. There is still alot of work that needs to happen on this before I am comfortable with these ideas.</description>

      <description>EUR/USD Still watching this as the ascending triangle is forming still and bouncing off the top of this range. I guess I should just get long and go for it.
GOLD The daily chart could convince you that there is a rounded bottom forming here over the course of the last 6 months. USD/JPY We have not really traded outside the opening level from the &amp;lsquo;flash crash&amp;rsquo; day. It looks this is a weak rally.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just completed Term 1 of Udacity&amp;rsquo;s AI for Trading Nanodegree program. This is not a review of the course content. This is a review for my own benefit of the some concepts that I need to work with and better understand. My verbal characterization of my understanding of these concepts will be crude, imprecise and potentially wrong. This is a work in progress.

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that you can have the move figured out but if you don&amp;rsquo;t get in and out at the right price, you can still lose. So I&amp;rsquo;ve made the right direction calls but my entries and exits have been stopped out.
I need to go through how I intend to improve this. These images do not show my entries and exits but I have a short for the USD/JPY and a long for the USD/EUR and USD/Gold.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The greatest risk is not taking a risk&amp;rdquo;.
These words stimulated something in my mind to the question: What unknown hazards am I accepting by not taking the risks that sit in front of me? Honestly, the question certainly charged a kind of zero-fucks courage. There is not one moment when you are not facing the unknown hazards of reality. And if this truly sets in you realize you just have to go for it at all times.</description>

Two years from now, where do I want to be, what do I want to be doing? Two years from now, I am trading for myself and I am very liquid with no financial doubts or concerns. I am location independent spending my time between Hawai&amp;rsquo;i, Bali, and Tokyo/Singporae/Hong Kong/NYC/London (some financial capital). Everyday I wake up and sit my morning meditation.</description>

      <description>Ever since I read Adventure Capitalist and Investment Biker the idea that you could use trading as way to express ideas about the world has really captivated me. Maybe that sounds like bullshit since I&amp;rsquo;ve only really started to give real attention to it. So be it. No more. Now it is true and I am living it.
The ideas that I want to express are my views about the direction of geopolitical relationships as well as the monetary relationships between nation states.</description>

      <description>So many systems, masters, gurus, experts, programs, classes. So many people striving, pursuing, seeking. So much human energy into this question, this pursuit. Clearly there must be answers. Maybe. Maybe the answers found, problems solved are those of the seeker. Are they your problems? If not, how can they be your answers? Do you know what you are actually after? Do you know what you actually want? Or have you just settled for someone elses desires, someone else&amp;rsquo;s problem, someone else&amp;rsquo;s narration of their solution, some one else&amp;rsquo;s system?</description>

      <description>Agency, competence, sovereignty, independence, self-sufficiency, freedom. A bunch of words. Abstractions that point to something outside of you. Defined in some book or by some other human. Seemingly common short-cuts we use to transact with other humans and ourself. I&amp;rsquo;m concerned when I use these abstractions with myself to compel behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s actually not just these words. Its almost many words for many different behaviors and outcomes. Why do I need words and abstractions to marshall my resources to ends that I find meaningful?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to David Goggins new book Can&amp;rsquo;t Hurt Me over and over again. There is something in the his reference to the path of most resistance and the spiritual and mental growth and abundance that lies on that path. I am sorry if that sounds like a bullshit line. But really, all abundance lies on that path. Material wealth, sure. There is also the wealth of energy and unknown that sits along that path.</description>

      <description>Since the UDacity course does not start until 12 December I decided to finish watching all the videos from 2nd Skies Forex. I also found a new tool; new for me at least. Trading View seems to aggregate the data feeds from a number of brokers and allows you to use their data and charting tools. Its a pretty great tool. You can even link your brokerage accounts so you can trade directly from the platform.</description>

      <description>Trading and markets have been on my mind for a very very long time. I first became very curious about trading when I read about Jim Rogers trip around the world in 2000. A few years ago I thought about trading and purchased a course from Chris Capre at 2nd Skies Forex to learn to trade. I never finished the course. I told myself I would go back and finish that course some day.</description>

      <description>In the twilight of my temporal youth, I decideded to start over. In some ways, I feel that my life has just started.
When your mind is consumed with something, not doing/living that thing is a kind of painful dishonesty. My relationship with pain is perhaps different than most folks. I don&amp;rsquo;t like pain that leads to regrets. I welcome pain that leads to freedom, awareness and peace.
So enough bullshit.</description>

Where are we? How did we get here?
I am a world citizen, currently based in Bali, Indonesia. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my post-university years in Hawai&amp;rsquo;i and California with meaningful episodes in Beijing, NYC, Shanghai, and Bogota.
In my past, I have done many things to make a living.</description>
