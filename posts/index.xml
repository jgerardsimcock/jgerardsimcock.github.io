      <description> Today looking at copper and oil to get a sense of metals and energy. For both we are back around levels that we saw when Trump took offfice. I don&amp;rsquo;t know it there is any relationship. The bull market that followed his arrival has completely retraced and we are back to where we started.

      <description>After having completed the work for term 1 of the Udacity Nanodegree I felt I need some more solidifiation of the ideas. I did some searching for possible trading strategies to see how they used PCA. There are many actually. I did find one that uses PCA, technical indicators and machine learning on forex. This is like the golden sweet spot for me. Here is that notebook. There is still alot of work that needs to happen on this before I am comfortable with these ideas.</description>

      <description>EUR/USD Still watching this as the ascending triangle is forming still and bouncing off the top of this range. I guess I should just get long and go for it.
GOLD The daily chart could convince you that there is a rounded bottom forming here over the course of the last 6 months. USD/JPY We have not really traded outside the opening level from the &amp;lsquo;flash crash&amp;rsquo; day. It looks this is a weak rally.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just completed Term 1 of Udacity&amp;rsquo;s AI for Trading Nanodegree program. This is not a review of the course content. This is a review for my own benefit of the some concepts that I need to work with and better understand. My verbal characterization of my understanding of these concepts will be crude, imprecise and potentially wrong. This is a work in progress.
Factor Models The origin of Factor Model is the French/Fama three-factor model.</description>

      <description>Are you worth it? Have you earned the privilege? Do you know how to value and protect the thing you say you value and care about? What have you given up to prove that it matters to you? What have you given to deserve it? What is the state of your mind when you interact with the thing you claim to love? Have you prepared it? Have you purified yourself in the fire?</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that you can have the move figured out but if you don&amp;rsquo;t get in and out at the right price, you can still lose. So I&amp;rsquo;ve made the right direction calls but my entries and exits have been stopped out.
I need to go through how I intend to improve this. These images do not show my entries and exits but I have a short for the USD/JPY and a long for the USD/EUR and USD/Gold.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The greatest risk is not taking a risk&amp;rdquo;.
These words stimulated something in my mind to the question: What unknown hazards am I accepting by not taking the risks that sit in front of me? Honestly, the question certainly charged a kind of zero-fucks courage. There is not one moment when you are not facing the unknown hazards of reality. And if this truly sets in you realize you just have to go for it at all times.</description>

      <description>An exercise posed today during the Udacity video.
Two years from now, where do I want to be, what do I want to be doing? Two years from now, I am trading for myself and I am very liquid with no financial doubts or concerns. I am location independent spending my time between Hawai&amp;rsquo;i, Bali, and Tokyo/Singporae/Hong Kong/NYC/London (some financial capital). Everyday I wake up and sit my morning meditation.</description>

      <description>Ever since I read Adventure Capitalist and Investment Biker the idea that you could use trading as way to express ideas about the world has really captivated me. Maybe that sounds like bullshit since I&amp;rsquo;ve only really started to give real attention to it. So be it. No more. Now it is true and I am living it.
The ideas that I want to express are my views about the direction of geopolitical relationships as well as the monetary relationships between nation states.</description>

      <description>So many systems, masters, gurus, experts, programs, classes. So many people striving, pursuing, seeking. So much human energy into this question, this pursuit. Clearly there must be answers. Maybe. Maybe the answers found, problems solved are those of the seeker. Are they your problems? If not, how can they be your answers? Do you know what you are actually after? Do you know what you actually want? Or have you just settled for someone elses desires, someone else&amp;rsquo;s problem, someone else&amp;rsquo;s narration of their solution, some one else&amp;rsquo;s system?</description>

      <description>Agency, competence, sovereignty, independence, self-sufficiency, freedom. A bunch of words. Abstractions that point to something outside of you. Defined in some book or by some other human. Seemingly common short-cuts we use to transact with other humans and ourself. I&amp;rsquo;m concerned when I use these abstractions with myself to compel behavior. It&amp;rsquo;s actually not just these words. Its almost many words for many different behaviors and outcomes. Why do I need words and abstractions to marshall my resources to ends that I find meaningful?</description>

      <title>The Path of Most Resistance</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to David Goggins new book Can&amp;rsquo;t Hurt Me over and over again. There is something in the his reference to the path of most resistance and the spiritual and mental growth and abundance that lies on that path. I am sorry if that sounds like a bullshit line. But really, all abundance lies on that path. Material wealth, sure. There is also the wealth of energy and unknown that sits along that path.</description>

      <description>Since the UDacity course does not start until 12 December I decided to finish watching all the videos from 2nd Skies Forex. I also found a new tool; new for me at least. Trading View seems to aggregate the data feeds from a number of brokers and allows you to use their data and charting tools. Its a pretty great tool. You can even link your brokerage accounts so you can trade directly from the platform.</description>

      <description>Trading and markets have been on my mind for a very very long time. I first became very curious about trading when I read about Jim Rogers trip around the world in 2000. A few years ago I thought about trading and purchased a course from Chris Capre at 2nd Skies Forex to learn to trade. I never finished the course. I told myself I would go back and finish that course some day.</description>

      <description>In the twilight of my temporal youth, I decideded to start over. In some ways, I feel that my life has just started.
When your mind is consumed with something, not doing/living that thing is a kind of painful dishonesty. My relationship with pain is perhaps different than most folks. I don&amp;rsquo;t like pain that leads to regrets. I welcome pain that leads to freedom, awareness and peace.
So enough bullshit.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve landed on my site.
This is an experiment. This is where I am posting updates and ideas that come to me.
Where are we? How did we get here?
I am a world citizen, currently based in Bali, Indonesia. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my post-university years in Hawai&amp;rsquo;i and California with meaningful episodes in Beijing, NYC, Shanghai, and Bogota.
In my past, I have done many things to make a living.</description>
