  <div class="content">
    <p>In the closing hours of the seminar we brought it all together with some conclusions and summary. Aphorism and poetry are information compression. It seems to be Talebs natural communication style.</p>

<ol>
<li>The world is more fat-tailed then you think</li>
<li>Your model has errors of 1 + alpha. That error will drastically shift your Mean and Standard Deviation more than you think. See 1.</li>
<li>How far off is your error is 1+ alpha, 1 or 2 standard deviations? Exact payoff is 1 standard deviation.</li>
<li>Better Convex than smart: Rather be a cook, than a chemist.</li>
<li>Focus on F(X) not X.</li>
<li>Mean Absolute Deviation over Standard Deviation</li>
<li>High returns, no volatility means short options (bad news). If you aren&rsquo;t blowing up, it is the calm before the storm.</li>
<li>Capping the tail is cheap, buying out of the money is cheap, exposure is cheap.</li>
<li>1/n for Apollo/Zeus sake</li>
<li>Nobody blows up on known risks. See 1.</li>
<li>Asymmetry in statement: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.</li>
<li>The lower probability, the harder to estimate</li>
<li>Options are convex to volatility.</li>
<li>The high water mark is not the high water mark. The Lucretius problem. The highest mountain is not the highest mountain.</li>
<li>Vol is good, risk is not: heart volatility, high volatility the less the tail risk. Something that has survived under volatility, is information they can survive.</li>
<li>No quantification of risk. Something is likely or not likely. Who cares if it is 10% possible. Payoff instead of frequency.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t optimize allocation</li>
<li>Correlation is not only not causation, it is not correlation</li>
<li>Correlation is independent</li>
<li>The box cannot measure itself: You cannot use a probability distribution to determine if an observation came from a distribution. (This is a deep point.)</li>
<li>What is the error. See 2.</li>
<li>We are good at measuring probabilities but not good at payoffs. Frequency space vs payoff space fluency.</li>
<li>Facts are anecdotes&hellip;except for tail events.</li>
<li>Only the hyperparanoid survive.</li>
<li>There is always a sucker and a suckee</li>
<li>If it makes sense, don&rsquo;t do it. Unless you want to be a sucker.</li>
<li>Max estimates of population average is better than sample average.</li>
<li>Impress the IRS not your boss. Be a wolf not a dog.</li>
</ol>

<p>One that did not make it but I think deserves it&rsquo;s place:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is better to be a warrior in a garden, than a gardner in a war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taleb really does communicate via aphorism. His communication has removed everything that is not information. A few more that I caught in passing.</p>

<p>Option is freedom, freedom is priceless</p>

<p>The more precise the regulation the more arbtirageable it is.</p>

<p>You are not paid by god for what makes sense, you are paid by humans for what they are willing to pay you.</p>

<p>Shadow mean is not observed mean</p>

<p>There is a Fucker and a fuckee. Who is the Fuckee in the trade? (See 24 above)</p>

<p>When in doubt do a little. When convinced, do nothing.</p>

<p>A final thought on living these ideas. As I write this, I am staring out the window onto a terrace in Bali watching some people &lsquo;do yoga&rsquo;. The only thing I can perceive when I look at this is how much we consume and perpetuate without really knowing anything about it. This is not a rant against any system like yoga. It is a two-sided argument. It&rsquo;s more about our habit as humans of using ideas and systems without understading them, without questioning them, about accepting ideas dogmatically. As I watch this, the yoga students are reproducing movements I&rsquo;ve seen around the world at yoga studios. It makes me wonder if its about &lsquo;doing yoga&rsquo; or &lsquo;having done yoga&rsquo;. The former is beneficial unconditionally, it is in the act, one that creates robustness and anti-fragility. This is the Talebian idea of if it works 2000 years ago and it works the same today. It works. It is Lindy. The latters benefit is extracted in the social status realm, where cool points are begged for &lsquo;having done yoga&rsquo;. This is fragile mediocrastan.</p>

<p>A final thank you to my classmates at RWRI. I wish I had more time to speak with all of you and more time to spend with those I did. Thank you of course to the instructors: Nassim Taleb, Raphael Daoudy, and Robert Frey. May we all continue to live a life worthy of the respect and honor of those who came before us and may we live to demonstrate what is worthy and honorable to those who come after.</p>
