  <div class="content">
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been back in NYC for about 6 weeks now. Things have not gone as planned. In many ways, I could not ask for more from the world. It forced a state of consciousness on me. I realized ex poste what kind of fantasy state I had created and that I was occupying. That state existed without sufficient contact with reality. In the past few weeks, I witnessed my states of consciousness fluctuate between confidence and its absence. Doubt, fear, worry, confidence, hope, assurance&hellip;perhaps infinite spaces in between. Really witnessing the movement across the spectrum allowed me to punch a few holes in the sturdieness of those states. Goenkaji, quoting the Buddha, speaks of Annicca. The fundamental nature of reality: it is constantly changing. Impermanence is the only feature of reality you may rely on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what has been the most &lsquo;helpful&rsquo; in moving through this shifting state but a few things, some old some new, have really assisted me along the way. In addition to meditation, I read a book by David Hawkins called Letting Go. Basically the idea is to interact directly with your emotions and feelings and let them go. Whatever you want or don&rsquo;t want, there is some set of emotions, fear, hope, doubt, hubris and letting go of the emotions releases you from the attachment to the things you do and do not want. In many ways, it was a psychological description of the same concept at the heart of the Buddha&rsquo;s message: attachment leads to suffering. Release the attachment, remove the suffering. I found it to be extremely helpful as I started to ask myself what I wanted to accomplish and why. What attachment was at the basis of my efforts? What inner lack or perceived insufficiency, that I am attached to, was I trying to solve with accomplishment in the world? I need the world, if only to satisfy my inner lack. But every effort and outward striving with that source of motivation is a reinforcement of the attachement to the inner lack. How can I act and succeed outwardly without this motivation? The book was helpful in providing some very useful ideas.</p>

<p>Another source of assistance has been hot yoga. I&rsquo;ve been doing hot yoga off and on for about 10 years now. Initially, I started to alleviate some physical pain and soreness. However, now, while I still use it for recovery and pain management, I also use yoga for shifting other parts of my consciousness. I find that when I string together a month of consistent practice in the hot room, I start to see myself and life different. I start to see areas for change and opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>The studio I&rsquo;ve been practicing has low ceilings so the heated panels are closer to the students. Also, it&rsquo;s New York in the Summer and so it has been a total shock to the system to get back into the hot yoga. There was one day I had a legit panic attack it was so darn hot. My body started shaking uncontrollably. In retrosprect, I know and understand the heat tends to ellicit certain states of consciousness and it is up to me to release the energy behind those states. That is the point of the practice in the hot room. Increase the level of discomfort and expedite the process of growth.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, I found myself once again in a very challenging position during class. I had made it through most of the class without any issue but about three quarters of the way through class I started to fall apart. I had to leave the room to get some fresh air and when I came back in I could barely focus. Suddenly, waves of sorrow, grief, and sadness overcame me. At first I was not sure what it was about. But then images of <a href="https://c4foundation.org/">Charles Keating IV</a> started flashing in my mind. I also started to think about the men who died in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-mpWyOB3JE">Operation Red Wings</a>. The anniversary of their death had just passed and I remember thinking how I could not be living life the way I dreamed. How could I waste what I have, waste what I have been blessed with. I started to have these feeling of broken promises. Feelings that I was not living my life, feelings that I had submitted to mediocrity, given up and passed up the best chance I have had to live the only life I have.</p>

<p>The feelings of broken promises really overwhelmed me. This was probably the most intense part. I felt like I had failed. I just started crying. This was not an empty thought. I had made a promise to myself once. This promise had to do with those men who died. I had wanted to participate in what they were doing. For a while it was a real possibility for me but I did not want to kill humans. I wanted that intensity. I wanted that level of living. I wanted that level of pushing, driving, performing. I wanted life at the highest volume. I STILL WANT THIS. But I would not kill for it. I still to this day cannot comprehend why we as a human civilization have systems to refine men to that level and we turn them to killing. And those systems exist to prepare men to kill. That is not their primary aim, I understand this. Maybe that is it. Maybe at that level of refinement there is something about life and death that becomes unified. I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>

<p>It is the question that still haunts me. The other side of the question is how can I refine myself and become all that I can become on this earth in this life. It really is not an idle thought. I have had nightmares since I was a child about this. In each of the nightmares, it is always the same. The grim reaper is standing over me. My awareness is floating above this, outside my body, watching the grim reaper. He is ready to take me.</p>

<p>When I was young, I thought it simply meant that I would die young. That I would not make it to 30. As I&rsquo;ve gotten older and I continue to have this dream, I see this as a sign for me to change. I now understand it as a warning. The reaper will take my life if I do not value it. If I do not live the life I see inside my heart then I do not deserve life. Every time the reaper comes, I know there is a big change coming, something to push me into the next phase of my evolution. Most recently, last September,the reaper came but this time it was different. It was the reaper, it was the vibration of the reaper, his energy. But I could see his face and he was wearing a grey and black jacket with ARMY written on it. He tried to kidnap me and take me away. I all remember is yelling &ldquo;Who the fuck are you anyway!??!!&rdquo; Then I woke up. What I remember from this dream is the zombified nothingness of this beings gaze. To me the warning had another piece of information. Do not become part of the army of the walking dead. They are trying to kidnap you and take you into their state of consciousness. You cannot let it happen. This is my interpretation of the dream.</p>
