  <div class="content">
    <p>Agency, competence, sovereignty, independence, self-sufficiency, freedom. A bunch of words. Abstractions that point to something outside of you. Defined in some book or by some other human. Seemingly common short-cuts we use to transact with other humans and ourself. I&rsquo;m concerned when I use these abstractions with myself to compel behavior. It&rsquo;s actually not just these words. Its almost many words for many different behaviors and outcomes. Why do I need words and abstractions to marshall my resources to ends that I find meaningful? Why not see it and act until the vision is realized?</p>

<p>I am addicted to other peoples ideas and thoughts.</p>

<p>I have become dependent on their thoughts and their organizaton of reality to organize my own. Other people&rsquo;s thoughts, other people&rsquo;s lives, other people&rsquo;s imagination, other people&rsquo;s motivation, everything that is not me.</p>

<p>To be fair its more habit than addiction. However, from the expression of the energy is the same.</p>

<p>Why cannot I not see the end and act, fail, reflect, and act again until I achieve the goal? It&rsquo;s an open question. Why do I need to know what another person did or thought or claims to have done or thought? A kind of very subtle cowardice and a lack of self-confidence that I can do, fail,reflect and do again and still believe in the process of doing, failing,reflecting and doing again.</p>

<p>The belief beyond doubt in the meta-loop is there for some activities. Just not for everything. The belief in the meta-loop exists. I guess for new, budding, hopeful activities, the belief in the loop is still weak.</p>

<p>I wanted to make it stronger so I can have real freedom, independence and agency.</p>
