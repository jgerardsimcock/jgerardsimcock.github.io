  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">Real Vision Workshop</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>For the past 4 years, I have been a subscriber to <a href="https://www.realvision.com"><strong>Real Vision</strong></a>. The content and interviews have sustained my &lsquo;dream&rsquo; about working in financial markets. Since leaving my job to focus on the markets full time, I honestly have not had time to really watch it. However, recently, they held a live traders workshop and since I happened to be in the United States, I attended. The event took place at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City. The agenda for the event was to bring in traders and macro guys to discuss their process and how they think about trading. The day featured <a href="https://twitter.com/Damianhorner"><strong>Damian Horner</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI"><strong>Raoul Pal</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aspentrading10"><strong>Dave Floyd</strong></a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TgMacro"><strong>Tony Greer</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.hedgefundtelemetry.com/about-us/"><strong>Tom Thornton</strong></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ttmygh"><strong>Grant Williams</strong></a>. I was so stoked about the possibility of chatting with these guys in person as I have watched them over the past 4 years.</p>

<p>When we entered the venue each of us got a lanyard with a color on it. It was a pretty cool energy and I was glad to be there. When the event started we learned that our lanyards were our table assignments. We all got assigned to tables and this would be our group for the rest of the workshop. This was a cool idea as it allowed us to get to know about 10 people over the course of the day.</p>

<p>The event began with Damian Horner, Real Vision co-founder, giving us a sort of ice-breaker intro. He comes from the advertising world and he wanted to disrupt our thinking a bit. He gave us the task of drawing a box and then drawing a line. I drew a line from beyond the bottom left corner to beyond the upper right corner. The line exceeded the boundaries of the box. Damian then asked if any of us had drawn a line outside the box, was the line straight or squiggly? What was its orientation? Lines drawn outside the box, is where the term &lsquo;outside the box emerged.&rsquo; Almost nobody did that. He made a claim that how we drawn the line is how we see ourselves. I thought there may be something to this as my straight line exceeded the limitations of the box. Seems right.</p>

<p>The rest of Damian&rsquo;s talk was about some psychology stuff and it was thought provoking. Here are a few of those insights. Expose yourself to lots of random ideas. Damian actually mentioned that learning new languages and living in foreign cultures is a great way to stimulate your creative mind. I always get my ego pumped up when I hear stuff like this because its my natural instinct. &lsquo;Creativity&rsquo; is a combinatorial process. At some point, idea babies that are the combination of previous ideas will start to emerge. Surprisingly, these creative, new ideas may actually revolt us at first. Humans do not like new ideas because we need to use energy to understand them. The part I think I enjoyed most was getting to see how his ideas and personality has affected Real Vision. He really is a creative guy and I can see his mark on the Real Vision brand.</p>

<p>Next up was Raoul Pal. Raoul is also a RV co-founder as well as the author of the <a href="http://www.globalmacroinvestor.com/"><strong>Global Macro Investor</strong></a>. Raoul wanted us to participate in his macro theme development process. He enumerated a sequence of ideas that could not be used as they were too obvious. Each table spent about 5-10 minutes thinking about some macro theme that would emerge over the next few years that would drive large-scale shifts in the markets. This was actually much harder than I thought it would be. My bias was for something like cybersecurity, data privacy or some kind of AI race theme. One of our table members had been reading some stuff about a global ice age that may be approaching. Others at the table were thinking about the climate changing in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>As the other tables shared their ideas it was clear that the cybersecurity and climate change questions dominated people&rsquo;s thoughts. So we went with both ideas. Raoul wanted us to look for verifiable trends in both themes to better understand them. Not surprising to me, the climate change trends were harder to identify then people really imagined. I offered a few ideas that seemed to be valued. Nevertheless, it became clear that if these trends do exist, verifying them in a meaningfully short enough time frame would be challenging. The cyber security issue, however, you could look for some companies who were either exposed to it or were trying to benefit from the vulnerabilities posed by cyber threats. One of the interesting ideas was to go long a cyber security index and go short all the big tech companies. The most striking part of this exercise was observing the whole process unfold in front of us. None of it was prepared and we were all working through the problem together.</p>

<p>Next up was Dave Floyd of Aspen Trading. Dave is a forex trader and the main idea he wanted to communicate was to simplify and remove. He indicated that every morning he spends about 3 hours from 4-7 am PST looking at the markets, thinking, analyzing, simulating what could happen and how he&rsquo;ll respond. He mentioned a few good techniques I had never considered. Move your stops to break even when you are positive. Another was put on a tester position and then add to it if you get confirmation. This was a good money management technique I&rsquo;d not considered. Quite frankly he shared alot of tactics and ideas with the group that were useful but the most important thing I drew from it was the need to spend time thinking, silently, undistracted by the world.</p>

<p>Following Dave was Tony Greer of TG Macro. I have to admit Tony was the most charismatic of the bunch. He was telling war stories and most of the audience was really taken in. He started with a question. What is trading? I responded that trading is self-expression. We went around the room and gave some of our answers. Tony wanted us all to know that trading was Freedom. He made the case, the money in our trading account made it through the grinder of our life, it made it through mortgage, car, food, all that shit that takes away from your cash-flow. He implored us to be default aggressive saying that to know the world one must construct it. You need to think alone, for yourself, live and breathe your position, understand it, simulate what can happen to it under all kinds of scenarios. Most importantly, you must be detached. He asked to be clear on how we will defend ourselves and how we intend to survive. He also stressed the importance of sentiment and the need to know what others think, not to shape your beliefs but to make sure your beliefs reflect what others may be anticipating. Finally, he shared with us the story of how he shifted from trader at a firm to a private trader and market commentator. He had been journaling the markets for a long time and sharing his thoughts with others. Eventually, enough people convinced him that he should dedicate himself to it. I liked that something he had honed and loved doing over the course of his career slowly emerged as the next thing.</p>

<p>Up next was Tom Thornton of Hedge Fund Telemetry who shared with us his experience both in the business and also as a market commentator. Unfortunately, I did not take notes for this session.</p>

<p>Finally, Grant Williams shared with us his process for writing <a href="http://ttmygh.com/"><strong>Things that make you go hmmm</strong></a> and distilling the information firehose. I absolutely love Grant&rsquo;s style and I loved watching him present it live. He often uses some parable or metaphor to tie the varied content about which he writes together. He shared with us the reality that he does not know really how it works but he always seems to come up with something. It strikes him and he goes with it. Another part of his presentation was from his interview series and he wanted to demonstrate how readers and viewers sometimes misunderstand the intent of the content. This was surprisingly hilarious. Grant earnestly discusses with these esteemed guests about their lives and how they got there. And then he&rsquo;d show us some comments from the comments section that criticized Grant and Real Vision for not doing what he told them he would not do: give investment ideas. And even afterwards for questions it still came up that people wanted investment ideas. Grant and Raoul dismissed the question gracefully.</p>

<p>For me one central theme emerged from this event. All the speakers held strong views about the importance of alone time, of thinking, of silent, peristent meditation on an idea. The clarity to think through and come to a strong view seems to be directly connected with your ability to distance yourself from the noise of the world and let the clarity emerge.</p>
