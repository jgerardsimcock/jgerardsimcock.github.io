  <h1 class="subtitle is-size-4-mobile is-size-3-desktop">RWRI 10 Day 2</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: These are notes written a few days after completion of seminar. My apologies in advance for any exclusion or misapprehension of critical details. Also, to complement some of the lecture content, I&rsquo;ve added related content from other sources.</p>

<p>Day 2 of RWRI 10 began with some stories about Neiderhoffer and a joke or two about the tardiness of Raphael. First the joke: Nassim indicated that he has never seen Raphael on time. When Nassim and Raphael first met it was at an interview of some sort and Raphael was late. Nassim&rsquo;s assistant called in, worried and confused, to let him know that Raphael had phoned and to say he was &lsquo;retarded&rsquo;. The assistant was very concerned that he may be taking a job with Nassim. Luckily, Nassim caught Raphael&rsquo;s mistranslation (<em>retard</em> is late in French) and understood that his meeting would start later than expected.</p>

<p>A story about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/10/15/the-blow-up-artist">Neiderhoffer</a>. I had never heard of this guy. Evidently, he was quite a hotshot. Evidently, Nassim has a close personal relationship with him. Evidently, Nassim and Neiderhoffer are literally on opposite sides of most trades. Nassim&rsquo;s argument, which turned out to be true, time and time again, was that your mathematical expectation is false and you will never realize theoretical or expected gains. The conditions under which your models are supposed to work, never actually materialize. In fact, your nightmares will materialize, unexpectedly and you will blow-up. What Neiderhoffer was doing was selling industrial quantities of options in the tale at a low price. When the market went down, he got a margin call and lost everything. The Neiderhoffer story is interesting because it is so close to <a href="https://steadyoptions.com/articles/how-victor-niederhoffer-blew-up-twice-r124/">Taleb personally</a>. He is aware that someone is taking the other side of the trade and that person, yes the other side is another human or group of humans, will face the consequences of blowing up. My sense is that it won&rsquo;t be pretty. I am sure Noah was troubled by all that was not saved on the Ark.</p>

<p>And it gets worse. The Wall Street rumor mill suggests that the clearing broker, Refco, that went bankrupt, did so as a result of liabilities associated with Neiderhoffer&rsquo;s account. If true, the counterparty risk wiped out not only Neiderhoffer but any one who Neiderhoffer relied on. Neiderhoffer was concave to risk and so was Refco. This is an example of non-ergodic contracts. You can be right on the probability distribution of outcomes. 99% of the time you are right. The consequences of the 1% negate any information in the other 99%. You are dead.</p>

<p>Taleb warns that unless you have infinite capital, you cannot play certain games. This may be true for some tail strategies as well as some naked put strategies. For the tail hedge strategy, how long must you wait until you are finally not wrong anymore? Maybe your negative carry will bleed you to death.</p>

<p>This led to a discussion on concavity/convexity. Expectation of f(x) DNE f(Expectation of x). The average of the function does not equal the function of the average. This is an important point. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality">Jensens inequality</a>. What happens to you when something else happens? What is your exposure? With a concave exposure you are looking at unbounded downside. With convex functions, the opposite. Anything convex will produce a bias above/below its naive expectation. This is a very subtle point and I think hard to understand unless you have either seen it in real life with the intuition aid of monte carlo.</p>

<p>Taleb makes a claim that anything involving debt will have this characteristic. And that real estate volatility ends up benefitting individual investors through the refinancing of mortgages with interest rate changes. If rates go up, home owners do not refinance, if they go down, they have incentive to do so. The bank, holding your mortgage, gets monthly small-scale returns when times are good. If times are really bad, they repossess a bunch of property whose value is declining in a nonlinear manner. It would seem that all banking activity is of this nature. And it makes me wonder if the whole debt-driven banking function is not fundamentally concave and bound to blow itself up. And is it any wonder that the backstop of the last crisis was the Fed who bought those mortgages. Now what will backstop the Fed?</p>

<p>A discussion of models and dimensionality. How much complexity can you model? What has more complexity: a highway or a forest? The dimensionality of nature is much greater than manmade objects. We actually attempt to reduce dimensionality. We are asked to look at the room we are in. Flat surfaces everywhere. Angles. Euclidean geometry found its way into everything. In the ancient world, man had structures that tried to replicate the dimensionality of nature. When I heard this I wondered if it was true. Flat surfaces remove the complex information.</p>

<p>Flat surfaces can be related to an artificial system vs the multi-dimensional organic world. It sometimes feels like a primary goal of the modern world is to remove the complexity of the natural world, to shield us from annihialation. I&rsquo;d agree that at some point, this was a &lsquo;good&rsquo; thing. But it is a little bit like the good bet that is right most of the time and then blows up. What kind of trade-offs are we making for some kind of short-term convenience that is actually making us more vulnerable to the complexity of life. Errors are not good if they kill but they are if you learn and become stronger, if you are convex to errors. Being smart is overrated. Just be convex so that your mistakes lead to opportunities. We may actually have entered a terminal process in modernity that leads to our extinction. If the stressor of the environment led us to our current state of evolution and we are systematically trying to remove the communication between man and his environment and dampen the information between them, then we may be increasing the negative convexity to life. Everything that is designed and over-engineered will work for a while, until volatility overwhelms starts to destabilize the system. Taleb asks us how we can know a healthy place for business. His response was look for the places with <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/bankruptcies">the most bankruptcies</a>. Even though the US has the highest total, the per-capita values of Hong kong and switzerland dwarf the rest of the world. Which makes sense. The city-state of HK and canton model of Switzerland forces an adaptive stressor on the inhabitants. Without resources, they must become resourceful. One of the students commented that Switzerland had one of the lowest per-capita education levels until a few decades ago. It&rsquo;s wealth preceded its education. Which suggests, again, education and certification and wealth connection is weak. The thing you care about is performance in the world, not performance on artificial and made up tasks. Modernity is fundamentally about gaming tasks for social status.</p>

<p>Stressors: Acute and Chronic. Taleb mentions a story from the Talmud about a man who would be punished by crushing from a massive stone. The father of the man had an idea to decimate the stone into 10000 pieces and reduce the blow. This was the equivalent of jumping from 100 feet once or 1 feet 100 times. Which would kill you. The scale transformation of an action shifts the properties and outcome of the act. For many stressors, we may be insensitive to small shocks and extremely vulnerable to large shocks.</p>

<p>If we view our health and the body as a complex system we can see that our health can be invulnerable to small shocks and very vulnerable to large one. Side note, I was hit by a bus as a child. I am alive but it shifted my life. From complex systems and evolution we can see that the properties of the individual parts do not sum to the functioning of the whole system. The interactions between the parts creates another dimension of robustness.</p>
