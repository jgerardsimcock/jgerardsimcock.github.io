  <div class="content">
    <p>&ldquo;The greatest risk is not taking a risk&rdquo;.</p>

<p>These words stimulated something in my mind to the question: What unknown hazards am I accepting by not taking the risks that sit in front of me? Honestly, the question certainly charged a kind of zero-fucks courage. There is not one moment when you are not facing the unknown hazards of reality. And if this truly sets in you realize you just have to go for it at all times. It&rsquo;s the necessary force to push you to choose the devil you don&rsquo;t know over the devil you do.</p>

<p>It is certainly true in a kind of meta-logic way that the greatest risk is not taking a risk. However, I have a more concrete version of the greatest tangible risk we take. It is to live, committed, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOowwi8xYUA">free from the known</a>. If we are talking about moment-to-moment, real-life risk taking the greatest risk you can take is the risk of total Freedom. And the more I think about it this idea begins to set in that if you believe in unconditional freedom, you are wedded to a kind of unbounded risk with terminal consequences. Freedom from the known is a committment and contract that must be renewed moment-to-moment. It is an abandonment. It is a committment to doing, to not knowing abstractly, but knowing only in the act. It is way of being that says, I will not live from other people&rsquo;s mind, from other people&rsquo;s experience, knowledge, resources. It is the committment to a kind of independence that believes the routines, systems, programs of others is what keeps me safe and that those boundaries are my bondage.</p>

<p>What is the risk in living free from the known?</p>

<p>Quite simply total failure, annihilation, alienation, exile, estrangement, the end of your life as you know it. As long as we stay within the boundaries of the establishment, the system, the structure, the routine, the program, we are in the known, we are within the bondage of the other. It is psychologically safe, it is socially safe. You&rsquo;ll know what to do next, people can help you if you forget, they can give you advice, they can console you if you fail, they can forgive you for trying and failing. You never really have to bear the responsibility, psychological or other, for your actions. Being totally, utterly abandoned by our tribe, group, whatever is the equivalent of death, the terminal event. Whatever that is, it seems like the biggest risk we can actually conceive of. This is what we risk when we live free from the known. This is the price of Freedom.</p>

<p>To acknowledge supreme inspiration from God or being or dharma or nature or the sky or whatever and to act on that inspiration is to abandon all other justifiable reasons and cut your tie with the authority of other men. To acknowledge and obey your own channel with a higher authority beyond the reach of any other human on this earth is to abandon and deny other humans claim on any kind of authority over you. And since you have rejected them, you are accepting your own estrangement, alienation and exile.</p>

<p>And it is hard to live free from the known, not only socially but individually, it is hard. It is hard to not get lost in other people&rsquo;s methods, and ideas. It is hard to not want to find a hack or a short-cut or a &lsquo;best way&rsquo; to do something. But those are all fictions. They actually don&rsquo;t exist until you find them for yourself. And again its strange that its easier to believe in all those fictions rather than your own experience in this moment. Right now when you need to act and make a decision, why is it so hard to accept the responsibility of your own decisions, your own inspiration, to do what is in your heart? Why?</p>
