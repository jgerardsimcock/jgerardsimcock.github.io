<p>What would it mean if I started my own trading operation?</p>

<p>I started to think about this question from a CTO&rsquo;s perspective. I wanted to understand the types of systems I would need in order to execute this successfully. Having completed <a href="https://pyalgo.tpq.io/">this</a> Algorithmic trading program I had a sense of what kind of systems I may need.</p>

<h4 id="securities-database">Securities Database</h4>

<p>The first part I would need to build this business is a securities database that would collect the time series data in real-time and then later be used as the raw material for research. I honestly, don&rsquo;t really have any strong opions myself and so I started researching on Stack Overflow as well as watching videos, reading blog posts. It is clear there are many options and opinions on how to construct a time-series database. Generally, there are SQL, NoSQL solutions. You could even just use a basic file system to organize your data. We did something similar to this at Rhodium for our climate data.</p>

<p>You also need to find a place to get the data. There are many sources for data. I am mostly interested in forex data so I started by downloading 4 hour candles for currency pairs, indexes and other securities from the fxcm api. I used this SDK to assist in the downloading. Actually you can get streaming minute candles from fxcm but it only goes back two weeks or so.</p>

<p>There is also a great resource <a href="https://www.histdata.com">here</a>. You can download actual FOREX, index and commodity tick data going back to the 2000s.</p>

<p>As far as where to put all this, I decided to go with <a href="https://github.com/manahl/arctic">Arctic</a>, which is based on MongoDB. I was a little uncertain at first because everyone uses SQL and I figured it was the best and only responsible solution. I was very surprised to see that a very large systematic fund such as MAN/AHL was using a NoSQL store for tick data. I actually set-up a SQL store for some equities data and I really did not like. It felt extremely rigid and unable to adapt. So far I&rsquo;ve only been loading data into Arctic. I&rsquo;ve note been doing any large-scale, concurrent reads from it for modeling or backtesting. I inserted 10 years of data for about 70 instruments in serial and it took about 3 minutes. I did not think that was too bad. That time includes the time it took to ping the server, wait for the response, download and insert the data. So about 3-4 seconds for each security for the duration fo the period. Not bad.</p>

<p>The next steps are to try and implement this on the cloud on AWS to see how it performs.</p>
