  <div class="content">
    <p>There are these moments I have in yoga when I am dying. It feels like death. I cannot breath. I am dizzy. My chest is pounding. I want to quit. I want to leave the room. I feel alone. I feel so terrible. I start to feel pity for myself. All of my attention falls into the chasm of my own pain and suffering. And not only that, I start to have feelings about that pain and suffering, I start to have negative feelings about the feelings. Feelings that I am weak, unworthy, I am not good enough, in short self-defeating thoughts of self-pity and victimhood.</p>

<p>The feeling is so similar to the moments during meditation when I am most agitated and most at pain. Sometimes when I sit, and certainly when I am on retreat, I experience tremendous discomfort. Similarly as the sequence above, I start to feel terrible and then I start to have negative feelings about the terrible feelings. And the main reason I reject these emotions is the feeling and belief that they are happening to me, to my body, mind and nervous system. It hurts me. And I do not want to feel pain and suffering. I am tired, emotionally and physically exhausted.</p>

<p>In both cases, I don&rsquo;t care what is happening to the other people in that moment who are inches away from me. I do not care how they feel. I do not care if they are struggling, I do not find encouragement in their strength nor do I find strength in my own state or ability to help them. I am totally locked in to my own feelings and suffering. The hypnotic power of self-pity is all powerful.</p>

<p>Not to mention, what is going on in the universe beyond my immediate perception which may include suffering on a scale beyond my comprehension as well as joy beyond my imagination. I have no consideration of either of these very probable states of the world outside of me.</p>

<p>This myopia is the source of tremendous suffering. It is the source of the neurotic state that perpetuates all suffering. I know this because when I start to detach and let go from the feeling of <em>my</em> suffering it starts to dissipate. When I detach from the victimhood and all the self-pity that is falling down on the idea of <em>me</em> the sensation shifts and has a totally different quality. Additionally, when I start to wonder and even imagine how terrible others may feel, my state is less of a burden. In that moment, both of these positions can be acknowledged and accepted and the grip of the suffering on my reality weakens.</p>

<p>The strongest point, I believe, comes down to feeling like a victim. Like the world is unfair, like somehow the world and God has conspired against you in a special way to amplify your suffering. This is the most poisonous thought in the world, I believe.</p>

<p>The process of separation and dissolution of the separation continues until nothing separates you and the unbounded field of being. Once we transcend one limitation something else may arise that we must address and transcend. When there are no more persecutions, no more victims and no more villians, nothing to overcome, nothing more to transcend, all that is left is the unification with what is. I know this is woo woo as fuck but really it can be experienced and one must first let go of their victimhood and self-pity. It is the first step. And as a part of that you must forgive that which you believe persecuted you, even if it is God himself, especially if it is God.</p>

<p>I believe this is what Jesus was experiencing in <a href="https://biblia.com/bible/kjv1900/Matt%2027.46">Matthew 27:46</a> when he said &ldquo;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&rdquo;. If you have ever seen the film &ldquo;<em>Last Tempation of Jesus Christ</em>&rdquo; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyTf7wR8vWI">this scene</a> depicts Matthew 27:46. In it, Jesus calls out to God, asking why he has been forsaken and abandoned by God. What you see is a man in total delerium. He is clearly suffering, but he is not alone. He looks at the other beings being crucified along side him. As if to suggest his acknowledgement of his own disregard for their suffering.</p>

<p>And then Jesus gets &ldquo;saved&rdquo; by an angel of mercy. Some being claiming to be his guardian, and sent from God, convinces him he has suffered enough. She tells Jesus that he is the Son of God but he is not the Messiah, the savior and liberator. She convinces him to end his suffering and she let&rsquo;s him down to contiue on with his life. SPOILER ALERT: that being turns out to be satan and she has deterred Jesus from his God-appointed mission.</p>

<p>What the hell does this have to do with anything?</p>

<p>I believe that when we fear that God has forsaken us, when we are suffering and we feel alone, victimized, and full of self-loathing and self-pity and in the name of mercy or fatigue or whatever we want to give up and we do give up several things happen. First, we fail to make our peace with God. The feelings of self-loathing, victimhood and self-pity have not been surrendered. We still view our suffering as special vis-a-vis the suffering of other beings. We do see it as <em>my</em> suffering and as long as that ocurrs we are separated from God and we are not liberated from our ego and its self-centered importance. If you can acknowledge that all beings suffer and that if I can detach from this suffering as mine, that other beings suffer too and if I experience liberation then potentially other beings too can know this and experience their liberation from the trap of the ego. Along with that and in conjuction with what the movie suggests, if you give up, you do not become the messiah. You do not fullfill your place in the world. You do not experience liberation, you do not become the one who is liberated from the limitations of the ego, from the smallness of me and mine.</p>

<p>So just let that shit go and keep letting go. Forgive, forgive, forgive. Liberation is in forgiveness of yourself, of God, of others, of all things. It is also the becoming of all you were meant to be.</p>
