  <div class="content">
    <p>You&rsquo;ve landed on my site.</p>

<p>This is an experiment. This is where I am posting updates and ideas that come to me.</p>

<p>Where are we? How did we get here?</p>

<p>I am a world citizen, currently based in Bali, Indonesia. I&rsquo;ve spent most of my post-university years in Hawai&rsquo;i and California with meaningful episodes in Beijing, NYC, Shanghai, and Bogota.</p>

<p>In my past, I have done many things to make a living. I&rsquo;ve been a linguist, a diplomat, managed business development for small businesses and startups. Most recently I was a data engineer/scientist. From these experiences, I know I can do whatever I want, whatever consumes me.</p>

<p>At this point in my life there are certain things I cannot stop thinking about. These things consume my life, my mind. Surfing, health/fitness, markets. Within each of these domains, the mind-body connection is primary. I spend alot of time thinking about how to use these avenues to make myself something and someone I can respect. When I look in the mirror, I want to be at peace with what I see.</p>

<p>A note on &ldquo;As it is&rdquo;. It refers to something the Buddha supposedly said. He supposedly wanted us to bring our attention to witness life as it is in each moment and not as we would like it to be. And if we can witness and remain aware of life moment to moment, then we can attain the awareness of the impermanent nature of life, that all things change. And that fundamental awareness is the basis for all freedom.</p>
