  <div class="content">
    <p>The question of where things come from is solved. There is no doubt about how to realize things in the world. What is needed is brought into existence in the world when it is needed. Until then it waits as potential. Until then, energy goes into the imagination and creation of what is to come. The relationship with this process grows stronger and stronger. It is the connection to this process that sustains life. &lsquo;Goals&rsquo; are simply now to remove all that is an obstacle to this constant connection. Letting go of fear, doubt, worry.</p>

<p>There is a 55 foot sailboat moored in Southern California. When we travel between the mainland and Hawaii, we do it on the boat. If we can, we try to participate in transpac cruises with other ships. Sometimes, we just want to go so we hop on a flight. Sometimes, we want to teach people so we wait a bit and get a crew together.</p>

<p>When we are in Hawai&rsquo;i we have a birthing either up in Haleiwa and sometimes we put at the Ala Wai. We have an apartment in the city that can sleep 4 people. There is a car that we can use to get around town. We also have a place in upcountry Maui. Sometimes, we go to Maui sometimes we go to Oahu. When not using the properties, we share them with our friends and family.</p>

<p>When We are on the mainland, we mostly stay at our mountain ranch. The mountain ranch has 100 acres of land. We&rsquo;ve got farmland and it is on this site we have our retreat center as well. The retreat center sits deeper within the property. On the ranch are animals like goats, chickens, pigs and cows. The animals are pretty much roaming wild except the chickens. The animals are used for food but we do it in the most humane way possible.</p>

<p>The mountain ranch has a stream that runs through it. The water comes from the ice and snow on the mountain that melts throughout the spring and summer. Our energy is mostly from solar and wind but we also have some bio mass. The ranch and farm are productive assets that generate lots of income. That income goes to fund the retreat center as well as the research center. The research center is a place where we sponsor and fund people to conduct research into alternative, decentralized systems of energy, manufacturing, food production, and communication.</p>

<p>The ranch is connected to the world. We have an airport and we are fully linked into the wider world via mesh network and internet. If we need something we can get.</p>

<p>Every 6 months we have a rotating class of researchers come in. One major part of their research period is an initial silent retreat. It allows them to wash their minds clean. They take another retreat about mid way through and then again at the end. The silence, we believe, allows them to access knowledge that may not be available to their conscious mind.</p>

<p>The researchers of course have access to whatever information they need. In addition, we provide lab space as well as protoyping facility for them to test their ideas. At the end of the six months, they present their ideas.</p>
